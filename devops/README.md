# DevOps & Deployment Stage

This folder documents CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure configuration, and runbooks.

- `devops.yaml` – Environment definitions, CI/CD stages, observability details.
- `runbooks/` – Operational runbooks (e.g., deploy.md) outlining deployment steps.
- `.github/workflows/` (outside this folder) reference these configurations.

Keep this information fresh so automated workflows and on-call engineers have clear guidance during releases.
