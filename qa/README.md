# Quality Assurance Stage

This directory captures testing strategy and QA results.

- `tests.md` – Test matrix outlining scenarios, priorities, and status.
- `reports/` – QA reports, defect logs, and test run outputs.
- `ai/logs/test_runs/` – Automation logs generated by QA agents.

Before releasing a change, ensure:

1. `tests.md` is updated with new scenarios or status changes.
2. QA prompts produce logs and defect reports in these folders.
3. Coverage requirements defined in the prompts (e.g., ≥ 80%) are met.
