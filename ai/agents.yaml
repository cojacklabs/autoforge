description: Agent roles, permissions, and communication boundaries for the ROS AI autonomous workflow.
note:
  All paths are relative to the repository root. When AutoForge is located inside
  another project (e.g., `custom-project/autoforge`), treat that subdirectory as the
  working directory and do not modify files outside it.
