# Change Management

- Use change_requests/\*.yaml to track scope changes; include acceptance criteria.
- Run impact analysis before code changes; update CodePlan/TestPlan accordingly.
- Follow docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md for commit hygiene and reproducibility.
- SemVer: major for breaking changes, minor for features, patch for fixes.
