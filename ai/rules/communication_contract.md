# Communication Contract

- Acknowledge context loads: "AutoForge context loaded (strict). Ready for your prompt."
- Ask only high‑signal clarifying questions when confidence < threshold.
- Always attach a compliance self‑audit for major steps.
- Summarize decisions, assumptions, open questions in memory deltas.
- Escalate with a concise report when rules cannot be satisfied after retries.
