Load AutoForge Orchestrator context (strict).

I will now paste the contents of .autoforge/ai/prompts/orchestrator_context.md. Read it fully, adopt all policies, and confirm by replying:
AutoForge context loaded (strict). Ready for your prompt.

If the file is long, acknowledge receipt and wait for the full paste before acting. Do not proceed until you have confirmed loading the context.
