objective: >
  Design and implement provider connectors with robust error handling, schema validation,
  retries/backoff, and mocks to support offline tests. Document configuration and
  ensure secrets are handled via environment variables only.
controls:
  max_retries: 2
  approval_gates:
    - "Before introducing a new provider requiring secrets or infrastructure"
    - "Before writing outside declared code targets or modifying CI/CD"
inputs:
  - "ai/integrations.yaml"
  - "api/openapi.yaml"
  - "docs/blueprint/tech.md"
  - "ai/code_targets.yaml"
constraints:
  - STOP for human approval when an approval_gates condition is met.
  - Use env vars for secrets; never commit credentials.
  - Provide a clear error taxonomy per provider; include retry/backoff.
  - Validate request/response schemas; generate mocks/fixtures for tests.
  - Write code and tests under paths defined in ai/code_targets.yaml.
deliverables:
  - "integrations/{provider}/client.{ts,js}"
  - "src/server/integrations/**"
  - "tests/integrations/**"
  - "ai/reports/integrations/{provider}_summary.md"
  - "ai/logs/integrations/session_{{date}}.md"

notes: |
  Start with one provider from ai/integrations.yaml. Propose a plan that lists
  env requirements, endpoints, schemas, and failure modes. Include test commands
  and how to run without real credentials.
