objective: >
  Define and execute a performance testing strategy; establish SLIs/SLOs with SRE/DevOps
  and provide tuning recommendations informed by measurements.
controls:
  max_retries: 2
  approval_gates:
    - "Before accepting SLOs or testing plans that impact release criteria"
inputs:
  - "devops/devops.yaml"
  - "docs/blueprint/tech.md"
  - "ai/code_targets.yaml"
  - "docs/observability/**/*.md"
constraints:
  - STOP for human approval before setting SLOs or gating criteria.
  - Keep artifacts inside AutoForge for planning/logging; write code/tests to code_targets paths.
  - Prefer reproducible tooling (k6/Jest bench/Artillery) and include run instructions.
  - Coordinate with SRE on SLOs and with DevOps on pipeline integration.
deliverables:
  - "docs/perf/plan.md"
  - "docs/perf/scripts/**"
  - "ai/logs/perf/session_{{date}}.md"
  - "ai/reports/perf/summary_{{date}}.md"

  Start with highâ€‘value scenarios: hottest endpoints, DB write paths, and UI flows.
  Document assumptions and environment configuration required to reproduce results.
