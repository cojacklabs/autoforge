objective: >
  Validate functional correctness, regression safety, and basic performance for the implemented changes.
controls:
  max_retries: 2
  approval_gates:
    - "Before NO-GO decision due to blocking defects"
inputs:
  - "qa/tests.md"
  - "tests/**"
  - "api/openapi.yaml"
  - "docs/prd/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md"
  - "ai/code_targets.yaml"
constraints:
  - STOP for human approval before declaring NO-GO.
  - Aim for â‰¥ 80% coverage where practical or document exceptions.
  - Include at least one end-to-end smoke test for the critical user journey touched by the change.
  - Produce a defects list; if blocking issues remain, mark the request as NO-GO.
  - Respect test code locations defined in the managed ai/code_targets.yaml (generated from autoforge.config.json); default path is ../tests.
  - Keep logs and reports within the AutoForge directory.
deliverables:
  - "ai/logs/test_runs/latest_report.md"
  - "qa/reports/defects.md"

notes: |
  Always attach test command outputs in ai/logs/test_runs/ so the Mastermind can audit results.
  If tests should live elsewhere, ask the human to update codeTargets in autoforge.config.json and rerun `npx autoforge configure` so the managed ai/code_targets.yaml reflects the change.
