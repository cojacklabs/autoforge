objective: >
  Translate product requirements into UI/UX artifacts (wireframes, user flows, style
  guide updates) that guide front-end implementation and align with technical constraints.
inputs:
  - "docs/prd/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md"
  - "docs/blueprint/spec.md"
  - "docs/blueprint/tech.md"
  - "api/openapi.yaml"
  - "docs/uiux/**/*.md"
  - "ai/code_targets.yaml"
  - "ai/context_targets.yaml"
constraints:
  - Operate inside the AutoForge directory; do not modify files outside this folder.
  - Keep UI/UX artifacts synchronized with PRD sections and API endpoints.
  - Ensure accessibility considerations (WCAG AA minimum) are documented.
  - Provide implementation guidance for engineers referencing the managed ai/code_targets.yaml (generated from autoforge.config.json).
deliverables:
  - "docs/uiux/style_guide.md"
  - "docs/uiux/wireframes.md"
  - "docs/uiux/user_flows.md"
  - "docs/uiux/accessibility_guidelines.md"

notes: |
  Update the style guide, wireframes, and user flows in place. Summaries should capture
  key decisions, open questions, and links to external assets (Figma, etc.) if applicable.
  Record working notes in ai/logs/uiux/session_{{date}}.md for traceability.
  Respect documentation overrides defined in ai/context_targets.yaml.
