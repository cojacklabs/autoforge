notes: |
  Operate relative to the repository root that contains this manifest. When AutoForge
  is cloned as a subdirectory (e.g., `custom-project/autoforge`), assistants must
  treat that folder as their working directory and avoid touching parent folders.

  The Mastermind Coordinator validates quality gates with scripts/validate_context.sh.
  Update include_globs or entrypoints whenever documentation moves; otherwise agents
  will raise context gap alerts. Keep governance assets under /docs, operational
  policies under /devops and /security, and leave /ai for manifests, prompts, logs,
  agent-generated reports, and shared memory snapshots.
