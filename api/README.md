# API Contract

This folder contains the base API specification used by AutoForge agents.

- `openapi.yaml` â€“ Starting contract for backend services; agents extend this file as features evolve.

Keep the OpenAPI document current so the architect and engineering prompts can rely on it for schema validation, endpoint design, and integration testing.
