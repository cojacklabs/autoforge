# AutoForge Autopilot Brief

## Objective: Enable AutoForge to run on autopilot by orchestrating multiple AI agents through the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

### Instructions for AI:

1. Interpret User Prompts: Take high-level user instructions and break them down into SDLC phases (e.g., planning, designing, coding, testing).

2. Assign AI Agents: For each phase, choose the appropriate AI tool (e.g., Claude for planning, Codex for coding) to handle that part of the workflow.

3. Plan and Blueprint: Use one agent to draft a PRD or architectural outline based on the user’s vision.

4. Implement and Test: Hand off to coding AIs for implementation, then to testing AIs for quality assurance and code review.

5. Iterate and Improve: Continuously allow the AI to refine AutoForge’s capabilities, making it better at running the entire process on its own.
