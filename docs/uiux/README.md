# AutoForge UI/UX Design Guide

This folder houses all UI/UX deliverables generated by the `uiux_designer` agent.
These artifacts bridge the gap between product specifications and front-end
implementation.

## Artifacts

- `style_guide.md` – Colors, typography, spacing, accessibility guidelines.
- `wireframes.md` – Page-level sketches or links to high-fidelity mockups.
- `user_flows.md` – Narrative flows describing how users accomplish key tasks.
- `accessibility_guidelines.md` – Checklist for WCAG compliance and usability notes.
- `user_flows/` (optional subfolder) – Additional detailed flow documents.

## Inputs

- Product requirements: `docs/prd/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md`
- Technical blueprint: `docs/blueprint/spec.md`, `docs/blueprint/tech.md`
- API contract: `api/openapi.yaml`

## Outputs / Handoff

The agent should:

1. Reference each PRD feature and map it to UI components.
2. Link UI states to relevant API endpoints.
3. Provide implementation notes for front-end engineers (component structure,
   state management hints, etc.).
4. Log summaries under `ai/reports/uiux/`.

## Usage

When running the UI/UX Designer prompt, ensure:

- Working directory is set to the AutoForge folder.
- All generated artifacts remain within `docs/uiux/` or `ai/reports/uiux/`.
- Front-end engineers consult the managed `ai/code_targets.yaml` (generated from autoforge.config.json) to implement the designs in
  the host project’s codebase.
- Execute `ai/prompts/uiux_designer.yaml` (or `autoforge/ai/prompts/uiux_designer.yaml` when embedded) to populate and maintain these files.

## Prompt Snippet

```
Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/uiux_designer.yaml
Update style_guide.md, wireframes.md, and user_flows.md based on docs/prd/ and api/openapi.yaml.
Log a summary under ai/reports/uiux/.
```

## Prompts

- `autoforge/ai/prompts/uiux_designer.yaml`
- Reference `autoforge.config.json` (contextTargets) / the managed `ai/context_targets.yaml` if assets live elsewhere.
