# Accessibility Guidelines

Use this checklist to ensure UI/UX outputs meet accessibility expectations (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum).

## Keyboard Navigation

- All interactive elements reachable via keyboard (Tab / Shift+Tab).
- Visible focus indicators on links, buttons, form fields.

## Color & Contrast

- Text contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 (body) and ≥ 3:1 (bold / large text).
- Non-color indicators for state (icons, patterns).

## Semantics

- Proper use of headings (H1-H6) for structure.
- ARIA labels/roles only when native semantics insufficient.

## Forms

- Label every input; include instructions and error messages.
- Support inline validation with accessible status messaging.

## Media & Motion

- Provide captions/transcripts for audio/video content.
- Allow users to disable autoplaying animations; respect reduced-motion preferences.

Document any exceptions and mitigation plans here before handing off to engineering.
