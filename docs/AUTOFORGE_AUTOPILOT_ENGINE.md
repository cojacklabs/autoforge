## 10. Success Criteria

```yaml
autopilot_success_metrics:
  maturity_level_1:
    - "Agents autonomously execute stages without manual triggering"
    - "Gate failures auto-remediate with 3x retry attempts"
    - "Human review required only for deployment and external integrations"
    - "ACTIVE_MEMORY captures all decisions across session boundaries"
    - "Escalation summary is clear and actionable"

  maturity_level_2:
    - "Agents make autonomous decisions within authority matrix"
    - "Conflicts resolved via arbiter pattern without human intervention"
    - "Success rate: 90%+ projects complete without escalation"
    - "Average retry rate: < 0.8 retries per gate"
    - "Time saved: 40% reduction in human involvement vs manual SDLC"

  maturity_level_3:
    - "Training pipeline produces measurable prompt improvements"
    - "Recipes evolve with each project; success rates improve 5-10% per cycle"
    - "New agents can be onboarded with template prompt + 5 examples"
    - "Token efficiency improves 20% over baseline (better prompts, fewer retries)"
    - "Framework has trained itself on 50+ projects; metrics show continuous improvement"

  long_term_vision:
    - "AutoForge runs continuously; new projects spin up and complete without human prompting"
    - "Models have learned to anticipate edge cases and propose solutions proactively"
    - "Codebase quality and delivery speed exceed 95th percentile of industry benchmarks"
    - "Non-technical founders can define a project and receive shipping code in 48 hours"
```

## 11. Next Steps

1. **Validate architecture** with AutoForge community/users
2. **Implement Phase 1** (state machine, memory schema, autonomy matrix)
3. **Run pilot** on 3-5 test projects with autonomy level 1
4. **Collect feedback** and iterate
5. **Expand to Phase 2** (full orchestration runner)
6. **Launch training pipeline** after 10+ projects complete
7. **Publish improvements** and promote successful recipes
