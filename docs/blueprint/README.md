# Blueprint Instructions

This folder captures product and technical blueprints that guide development.

- `AGENTIC_BLUEPRINT.md` – Top-level architecture and lifecycle expectations.
- `spec.md` – Detailed functional specification for current milestone.
- `tech.md` – Technology decisions, stack choices, and architectural trade-offs.
- `vision.md` – Product vision and guiding principles.

Update these documents whenever features are added or architecture changes. Other
agents (UI/UX, Engineering, QA) read these files as their source of truth.
