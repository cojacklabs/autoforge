# Product Requirements Overview

Use this folder to store product requirements and user stories.

- `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md` â€“ Core PRD document outlining features, personas, and acceptance criteria.
- Additional subfolders/files can be added for epics, user stories, or backlog exports.

Keep this document up to date; downstream agents (UI/UX Designer, Architect, QA)
depend on it to ensure deliverables align with business goals.
