# Diagrams

This directory stores architecture diagrams and other visual models referenced by the architect and engineering agents.

Recommended files:

- `application_architecture.mmd` – System layout
- `data_model.mmd` – Database entities/relationships
- `workflow.mmd` – Key process flows
- `infra.mmd` – Deployment topology

Update diagrams whenever architecture changes so the prompts have accurate visuals to reference.
