# Feasibility Brief â€“ Team Todo App

## Summary

- Market gap for small-team collaboration tools that are simpler than full PM suites.
- Users prioritized quick task entry, assignments, due dates, and basic progress tracking.
- MVP should focus on responsive web experience with email/password auth.

## Key Findings

- Competitors (Trello/Asana) perceived as heavy for small teams; opportunity to differentiate on simplicity.
- Interviewees emphasized: due dates, reminders, ability to assign tasks to teammates.
- Real-time updates nice-to-have; can defer to Phase 2 (websocket support).

## Risks

- Notification overload; start with simple daily digest.
- Data privacy considerations even for small teams (must use secure storage and HTTPS).

## Recommendations

- Build React frontend with simple kanban board.
- Node/Express backend with REST API; Postgres for persistence.
- MVP feature set: tasks CRUD, assignments, due dates, notes, simple status.

## Next Steps

- Update PRD with prioritized features and user stories.
- Proceed to blueprint and UI/UX design stages.
