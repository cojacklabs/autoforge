# Security Stage

Security documentation and assessments live here.

- `SECURITY_READINESS.md` – Checklist for security posture and policies.
- `reports/` – Security audit outputs, findings, and mitigation plans generated by the security agent.

Keep this information current so security prompts (and auditors) can evaluate compliance before deployment.

## Prompts

- `.autoforge/ai/prompts/security_engineer.yaml`
