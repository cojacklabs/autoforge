                          DOCUMENTATION AS UX
================================================================================

Documentation is not just reference—it's the primary user interface:

  ✅ Copy/paste blocks are actual code users run
  ✅ Prompts in docs are exactly what users paste
  ✅ Examples are tested and runnable
  ✅ Navigation guides users through workflows
  ✅ Links are the "Next" button in user journey

This means:
  • Every code block must be perfect
  • Every prompt must work as-is
  • Every link must be valid
  • Every example must be tested
  • Every instruction must be clear

All of the above has been verified and standardized.
