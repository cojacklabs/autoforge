# AutoForge AI-Driven SDLC Enhancement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to evolve AutoForge into an AI-driven SDLC platform that supports autonomous learning and scalable development. The goal is to enable AI agents to learn from feedback, improve over time, and assist users in building robust applications from blueprints.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Structured Feedback Loop
- **Objective**: Allow AI agents to receive feedback on their outputs and use that feedback for continuous improvement.
- **Implementation**: After each task, results are logged and rated by a human reviewer or automated evaluator. Ratings are stored in a structured format.

### 2. AutoTrainer Module
- **Objective**: Introduce a training pipeline to fine-tune AI models based on feedback.
- **Implementation**: The `AutoTrainer` module aggregates feedback logs and uses them to fine-tune AI models via Vertex AI or a local training pipeline.

### 3. Memory and Knowledge Storage
- **Objective**: Maintain a knowledge base of past projects, decisions, and corrections for reference.
- **Implementation**: Store project history in a vector store or knowledge base. Agents can query this memory to retrieve insights and avoid repeating past mistakes.

### 4. Blueprint Interpretation Layer
- **Objective**: Improve how agents interpret and learn from user-provided blueprints.
- **Implementation**: Log how blueprints are interpreted and track any misunderstandings. Use this data to refine blueprint instructions over time.

### 5. Scalability and Deployment Configuration
- **Objective**: Prepare AutoForge for scalable deployments.
- **Implementation**: Automate the generation of deployment configurations (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to facilitate easy scaling on cloud platforms.

## Final Thoughts

With these enhancements, AutoForge will not only assist in coding but will also evolve into a comprehensive SDLC platform that learns and improves with each project. Users can rely on a truly adaptive AI team to guide them from planning to deployment, no matter the scale.
