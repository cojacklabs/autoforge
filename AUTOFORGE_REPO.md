This file is a merged representation of a subset of the codebase, containing files not matching ignore patterns, combined into a single document by Repomix.
The content has been processed where comments have been removed, line numbers have been added.

# File Summary

## Purpose
This file contains a packed representation of a subset of the repository's contents that is considered the most important context.
It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
or other automated processes.

## File Format
The content is organized as follows:
1. This summary section
2. Repository information
3. Directory structure
4. Repository files (if enabled)
5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  a. A header with the file path (## File: path/to/file)
  b. The full contents of the file in a code block

## Usage Guidelines
- This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  original repository files, not this packed version.
- When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  between different files in the repository.
- Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  the same level of security as you would the original repository.

## Notes
- Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
- Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
- Files matching these patterns are excluded: **/*.log, **/*.tmp, **/.cache/**, **/.git/**, **/build/**, **/dist/**, **/node_modules/**, *.test.ts, ai/logs/**, ai/reports/**
- Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
- Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
- Code comments have been removed from supported file types
- Line numbers have been added to the beginning of each line
- Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

`````markdown
  1: # AutoForge Multi‑Project Guide
  2: 
  3: Generalized, role‑aware, and planning‑first guidance for using AutoForge as a centralized multi‑agent SDLC platform across many different projects. This document distills lessons from prior reviews and refactors them so both technical and non‑technical professionals can guide an application from idea → production with clear checkpoints, observability, and approvals.
  4: 
  5: ---
  6: 
  7: ## Who This Is For
  8: 
  9: - Non‑technical stakeholders (founders, product owners, domain experts) who need a structured, low‑friction way to shape requirements and approve outcomes.
 10: - Technical practitioners (architects, engineers, QA, security, DevOps/SRE, data/AI) who want repeatable workflows, handoffs, and quality gates.
 11: 
 12: Use this guide alongside:
 13: 
 14: - docs/QUICKSTART.md – CLI and first‑run flow
 15: - docs/PROMPT_HANDBOOK.md – Ready‑made prompt snippets
 16: - ai/AGENTS.md – Roles, handoffs, progress log
 17: - ai/context.manifest.yaml – Context roots and quality gates
 18: - docs/ai/AGENT_AUTONOMY_GUIDE.md – Operating model and boundaries
 19: 
 20: ---
 21: 
 22: ## Core Principles (Project‑Agnostic)
 23: 
 24: 1. Planning‑first, code‑second
 25:    - Establish vision, PRD, blueprints, and quality gates before writing code. Allow “planning stubs” for fast iteration with explicit approvals.
 26: 
 27: 2. Role specialization with explicit handoffs
 28:    - Distinct agents (Product, Architecture, Engineering, QA, Security, DevOps/SRE, UI/UX, Performance) collaborate via structured prompts and JSON handoff payloads.
 29: 
 30: 3. Human‑in‑the‑loop control points
 31:    - High‑impact actions (architecture deltas, production deploys, critical tests, security exceptions) require human approval.
 32: 
 33: 4. Context memory and observability
 34:    - Centralize memory files, logs, and audit trails. Persist decisions and outcomes between sessions.
 35: 
 36: 5. Quality gates as guardrails
 37:    - Enforce completeness (PRD present, diagrams, API, security, observability, perf plans) with lightweight stubs during early exploration.
 38: 
 39: 6. Extensible templates and “recipes”
 40:    - Package common workflows by domain (e.g., SaaS app, analytics platform, mobile app) so teams can start fast and stay consistent.
 41: 
 42: 7. Secure by default
 43:    - Role‑based access, write scopes, secrets hygiene, immutable logs, and compliance reporting baked into the process.
 44: 
 45: 8. Continuous learning
 46:    - Capture feedback/errors/successes and roll up into prompts, rules, and future iterations.
 47: 
 48: ---
 49: 
 50: ## Overview of the AutoForge Operating Model
 51: 
 52: - Two‑world model: Human realm (docs/, api/, diagrams/, devops/, security/, qa/) vs AI realm (ai/ manifests, prompts, logs, memory, reports).
 53: - Configuration drives behavior:
 54:   - `autoforge.config.json` defines code targets and context overrides.
 55:   - `npx autoforge configure` keeps managed YAML (ai/code_targets.yaml, ai/context_targets.yaml) synchronized.
 56: - Observability by default:
 57:   - Use `npx autoforge validate` to enforce quality gates.
 58:   - Use `npx autoforge snapshot [path]` to generate REPO.md for sharing structure with assistants.
 59:   - Maintain activity logs under `ai/logs/**` and short, durable memory in `ai/memory/**`.
 60: 
 61: ---
 62: 
 63: ## Roles and Collaboration
 64: 
 65: Baseline roles (customize per project via `ai/agents.yaml`):
 66: 
 67: - Discovery Researcher – Gather inputs and feasibility.
 68: - Product Manager – Vision, PRD, acceptance criteria.
 69: - Architect – Systems, diagrams, and API.
 70: - Full‑Stack Engineer – Code/tests aligned to contracts.
 71: - QA Engineer – Functional/regression testing and quality reporting.
 72: - Security Engineer – Threat modeling, dependency checks, policy.
 73: - DevOps Engineer – CI/CD, deployments, and runbooks.
 74: - SRE – Observability, SLI/SLOs, alerts.
 75: - UI/UX Designer – Wireframes, flows, style guide, a11y.
 76: - Performance Engineer – Perf plans and scripts.
 77: - Mastermind Coordinator – Orchestration, guardrails, and summaries.
 78: 
 79: Optional roles (add as needed):
 80: 
 81: - Integration Engineer – Third‑party APIs (payments, data providers, analytics).
 82: - Payments Engineer – Billing/subscriptions, webhooks, reconciliation.
 83: - Data Analyst – Dashboards, KPIs, insights.
 84: - Compliance Officer – Audit trails, regulatory outputs.
 85: 
 86: Handoffs:
 87: 
 88: - Use the schema in `docs/MASTERMIND_PROMPTING_GUIDE.md` to exchange inputs, constraints, and deliverables.
 89: - Enforce exit conditions and “max retries” to avoid infinite loops.
 90: - If context is missing/invalid, halt and escalate—never guess.
 91: 
 92: ---
 93: 
 94: ## Human Checkpoints and Approvals
 95: 
 96: Design decisions that require explicit acknowledgment:
 97: 
 98: - Architecture deltas or new external integrations
 99: - Touching `devops/**`, production deployments, or secrets
100: - Security findings, policy exceptions, or P0 regressions
101: - Large refactors or migrations
102: 
103: Implementation tips:
104: 
105: - Each prompt should surface a “STOP for approval” step before critical changes.
106: - Assistants should summarize risk, blast radius, and rollback strategy.
107: 
108: ---
109: 
110: ## Memory, Logging, and Auditability
111: 
112: - Persist key decisions in `ai/memory/ACTIVE_MEMORY.yaml` and update it at major handoffs.
113: - Write structured logs to `ai/logs/**` (consider a single `activity.jsonl` stream for session summaries).
114: - Store concise outcomes in `ai/reports/**` (e.g., kickoff, retrospectives, UI/UX updates).
115: - Keep `REPO.md` current with `npx autoforge snapshot [path]` for new collaborators/agents.
116: 
117: ---
118: 
119: ## Quality Gates (Default Set)
120: 
121: Common baseline checks (customize in `ai/context.manifest.yaml`):
122: 
123: - API contract present (e.g., `api/openapi.yaml` or planning stub)
124: - Architecture diagram(s) present (or planning stubs)
125: - Security readiness checklist present
126: - PRD present
127: - UI/UX style guide present
128: - Observability docs present (dashboards/alerts/SLOs)
129: - Optional: Tests present, CI config present, Performance plan/scripts present
130: 
131: Note: File paths are case‑sensitive. Ensure manifest entries match on‑disk filenames.
132: 
133: ---
134: 
135: ## Project Recipes (Assembly Line Templates)
136: 
137: Recipes define who does what, in which order, with which gates. Create one per domain or product family and store under `docs/blueprint/recipes/*.yaml`.
138: 
139: Example (generic):
140: 
141: ```yaml
142: name: default_web_app
143: stages:
144:   - id: idea_intake
145:     role: product_manager
146:     inputs: [ideas/**]
147:     deliverables:
148:       - docs/prd/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md
149:     approvals: [human]
150: 
151:   - id: architecture
152:     role: architect
153:     inputs: [docs/prd/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md]
154:     deliverables:
155:       - api/openapi.yaml
156:       - diagrams/system.mmd
157:     approvals: [human]
158: 
159:   - id: engineering
160:     role: fullstack_engineer
161:     inputs: [api/openapi.yaml, docs/blueprint/tech.md]
162:     deliverables:
163:       - src/**
164:       - tests/**
165:     approvals: []
166: 
167:   - id: qa
168:     role: qa_engineer
169:     inputs: [tests/**, api/openapi.yaml]
170:     deliverables:
171:       - qa/reports/test_report.md
172:     approvals: [human]
173: 
174:   - id: security
175:     role: security_engineer
176:     inputs: [security/**, devops/devops.yaml]
177:     deliverables:
178:       - security/reports/findings.md
179:     approvals: [human]
180: 
181:   - id: release
182:     role: devops_engineer
183:     inputs: [qa/reports/test_report.md]
184:     deliverables:
185:       - ai/logs/deployments/*_deploy.md
186:     approvals: [human]
187: ```
188: 
189: Use recipes to seed `automation_bootstrap` behavior (select the recipe, expand steps, orchestrate prompts, enforce gates, and pause for approvals).
190: 
191: ---
192: 
193: ## Integrations and Plugins (API Ecosystem)
194: 
195: Standardize integrations so agents can propose, implement, test, and maintain connectors.
196: 
197: 1) Register providers in `ai/integrations.yaml`:
198: 
199: ```yaml
200: providers:
201:   stripe:
202:     env: [STRIPE_SECRET, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET]
203:     sdks: ["@stripe/stripe-js", "stripe"]
204:     deliverables:
205:       - src/server/payments/**
206:       - docs/security/stripe.md
207:       - tests/payments/**
208:   analytics_provider:
209:     env: [ANALYTICS_KEY]
210:     sdks: ["analytics-sdk"]
211:     deliverables:
212:       - src/services/analytics/**
213:       - tests/analytics/**
214: ```
215: 
216: 2) Constrain write paths for new roles (e.g., `integration_engineer`, `payments_engineer`) in `ai/agents.yaml`.
217: 
218: 3) Require:
219: 
220: - Secrets only via environment variables
221: - Retries/backoff and error taxonomies
222: - Schemas and mocks/fixtures for offline tests
223: 
224: ---
225:

306: 
307: ---
308: 
309: ## Implementation Roadmap (Framework‑Level)
310: 
311: Use this backlog to evolve AutoForge itself so every project benefits.
312: 
313: - Now
314:   - Add default recipes under `docs/blueprint/recipes/` (web_app, analytics_app, mobile_app).
315:   - Introduce `ai/integrations.yaml` and new roles: `integration_engineer`, `payments_engineer`, `data_analyst`, `compliance_officer`.
316:   - Add STOP/APPROVAL steps + halt/exit conditions + max retries across role prompts.
317:   - Standardize `ai/logs/activity.jsonl` session summaries; document the format.
318: 
319: - Next
320:   - Add quality gates for “tests present” and “CI config present”.
321:   - Provide connector scaffolds (env, retries, schemas, mocks) for popular providers.
322:   - Seed a docs/observability package with example dashboards/alerts and SLO templates.
323: 
324: - Later
325:   - Optional UI assistant to review approvals and orchestrate multi‑agent runs.
326:   - Lightweight policy engine to enforce write scopes and sign off rules.
327:   - Pluggable analytics for agent performance and process optimization.
328: 
329: ---
330: 
331: ## Non‑Technical Path (From Scratch)
332: 
333: 1. Capture the idea
334:    - Run the Idea Conversation prompt (see docs/PROMPT_HANDBOOK.md) to interview on goals, audience, and risks.
335:    - The agent drafts/updates `ideas/` and a PRD stub.
336: 
337: 2. Approve the plan
338:    - Review PRD, high‑level architecture, and UI/UX sketches (wireframes/user flows/style guide).
339: 
340: 3. Orchestrate the build
341:    - Use a project recipe to guide the agent sequence with clear approvals.
342:    - Agents propose tests, security checklists, and observability from the start.
343: 
344: 4. Validate and deploy
345:    - Inspect QA and security reports; approve the deployment plan.
346:    - Receive a simple release summary and next‑step recommendations.
347: 
348: ---
349: 
350: ## Technical Path (From Scratch or Existing Codebase)
351: 
352: 1. Install and initialize
353:    - `npm install --save-dev @cojacklabs/autoforge`
354:    - `npx autoforge init`
355: 
356: 2. Configure
357:    - Update `autoforge.config.json` (codeTargets/contextTargets) to match your repo.
358:    - `npx autoforge configure`
359: 
360: 3. Load context and validate gates
361:    - `npx autoforge load` then paste the onboarding block into your AI tool.
362:    - `npx autoforge validate` and address missing gates (use planning stubs if needed).
363: 
364: 4. Snapshot (optional but recommended)
365:    - `npx autoforge snapshot` to create `REPO.md` for collaborators/agents.
366: 
367: 5. Orchestrate via prompts
368:    - Kick off with `automation_bootstrap`, then follow recipe‑driven handoffs.
369: 
370: ---
371: 
372: ## Security, Privacy, and Access Control
373: 
374: - Constrain agent write scopes in `ai/agents.yaml`.
375: - Keep `write_protect` rules for critical manifests and governance docs.
376: - Record immutable audit logs (timestamps, actor, action, path) and store under `ai/logs/**`.
377: - Enforce secrets via environment variables and rotate regularly.
378: 
379: ---
380: 
381: ## Continuous Learning and Improvement
382: 
383: - Aggregate session outcomes and feedback under `ai/logs/learning/`.
384: - Publish periodic summaries to `ai/reports/learning/` with action items (prompt changes, new gates, template updates).
385: - Refresh agent context with `npx autoforge load|refresh` after material changes.
386: 
387: ---
388: 
389: ## Quick Checklist (Any Project)
390: 
391: - [ ] Initialize AutoForge and configure targets
392: - [ ] Capture idea → PRD → diagrams → API draft
393: - [ ] Validate quality gates (allow planning stubs initially)
394: - [ ] Choose a recipe and run orchestration
395: - [ ] Enforce approvals at critical steps
396: - [ ] Generate code and tests inside declared targets
397: - [ ] Run QA, security, perf checks; fix findings
398: - [ ] Prepare deploy plan, execute, log results
399: - [ ] Update memory and retrospective
400: 
401: ---
402: 
403: ## Notes and Pitfalls
404: 
405: - Case sensitivity matters: ensure `ai/context.manifest.yaml` file paths exactly match on‑disk names.
406: - Keep prompts minimal but strict: define constraints, deliverables, and explicit stop/approval points.
407: - If a role needs new paths, update `ai/agents.yaml` and re‑validate before running prompts.

412: ## Adapting to Your Domain
413: 
414: Create or customize a recipe for your domain (e.g., fintech, healthcare, ecommerce, analytics, mobile). Define:
415: 
416: - Stages, owners (roles), deliverables, and quality gates
417: - Integration providers and required secrets
418: - Performance and observability budgets
419: - Security/compliance expectations (e.g., SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR)
420: 
421: Start simple; iterate with the agent network, and promote learned patterns into shared recipes for future projects.

## File: AUTOFORGE_REPO.md
`````markdown
   1: This file is a merged representation of a subset of the codebase, containing files not matching ignore patterns, combined into a single document by Repomix.
   2: The content has been processed where comments have been removed, line numbers have been added.
   3: 
   4: # File Summary
   5: 
   6: ## Purpose
   7: This file contains a packed representation of a subset of the repository's contents that is considered the most important context.
   8: It is designed to be easily consumable by AI systems for analysis, code review,
   9: or other automated processes.
  10: 
  11: ## File Format
  12: The content is organized as follows:
  13: 1. This summary section
  14: 2. Repository information
  15: 3. Directory structure
  16: 4. Repository files (if enabled)
  17: 5. Multiple file entries, each consisting of:
  18:   a. A header with the file path (## File: path/to/file)
  19:   b. The full contents of the file in a code block
  20: 
  21: ## Usage Guidelines
  22: - This file should be treated as read-only. Any changes should be made to the
  23:   original repository files, not this packed version.
  24: - When processing this file, use the file path to distinguish
  25:   between different files in the repository.
  26: - Be aware that this file may contain sensitive information. Handle it with
  27:   the same level of security as you would the original repository.
  28: 
  29: ## Notes
  30: - Some files may have been excluded based on .gitignore rules and Repomix's configuration
  31: - Binary files are not included in this packed representation. Please refer to the Repository Structure section for a complete list of file paths, including binary files
  32: - Files matching these patterns are excluded: **/*.log, **/*.tmp, **/.cache/**, **/.git/**, **/build/**, **/dist/**, **/node_modules/**, *.test.ts, ai/logs/**, ai/reports/**
  33: - Files matching patterns in .gitignore are excluded
  34: - Files matching default ignore patterns are excluded
  35: - Code comments have been removed from supported file types
  36: - Line numbers have been added to the beginning of each line
  37: - Files are sorted by Git change count (files with more changes are at the bottom)

 463:   1: # AutoForge Multi‑Project Guide
 464:   2: 
 465:   3: Generalized, role‑aware, and planning‑first guidance for using AutoForge as a centralized multi‑agent SDLC platform across many different projects. This document distills lessons from prior reviews and refactors them so both technical and non‑technical professionals can guide an application from idea → production with clear checkpoints, observability, and approvals.
 466:   4: 
 467:   5: ---
 468:   6: 
 469:   7: ## Who This Is For
 470:   8: 
 471:   9: - Non‑technical stakeholders (founders, product owners, domain experts) who need a structured, low‑friction way to shape requirements and approve outcomes.
 472:  10: - Technical practitioners (architects, engineers, QA, security, DevOps/SRE, data/AI) who want repeatable workflows, handoffs, and quality gates.
 473:  11: 
 474:  12: Use this guide alongside:
 475:  13: 
 476:  14: - docs/QUICKSTART.md – CLI and first‑run flow
 477:  15: - docs/PROMPT_HANDBOOK.md – Ready‑made prompt snippets
 478:  16: - ai/AGENTS.md – Roles, handoffs, progress log
 479:  17: - ai/context.manifest.yaml – Context roots and quality gates
 480:  18: - docs/ai/AGENT_AUTONOMY_GUIDE.md – Operating model and boundaries
 481:  19: 
 482:  20: ---
 483:  21: 
 484:  22: ## Core Principles (Project‑Agnostic)
 485:  23: 
 486:  24: 1. Planning‑first, code‑second
 487:  25:    - Establish vision, PRD, blueprints, and quality gates before writing code. Allow “planning stubs” for fast iteration with explicit approvals.
 488:  26: 
 489:  27: 2. Role specialization with explicit handoffs
 490:  28:    - Distinct agents (Product, Architecture, Engineering, QA, Security, DevOps/SRE, UI/UX, Performance) collaborate via structured prompts and JSON handoff payloads.
 491:  29: 
 492:  30: 3. Human‑in‑the‑loop control points
 493:  31:    - High‑impact actions (architecture deltas, production deploys, critical tests, security exceptions) require human approval.
 494:  32: 
 495:  33: 4. Context memory and observability
 496:  34:    - Centralize memory files, logs, and audit trails. Persist decisions and outcomes between sessions.
 497:  35: 
 498:  36: 5. Quality gates as guardrails
 499:  37:    - Enforce completeness (PRD present, diagrams, API, security, observability, perf plans) with lightweight stubs during early exploration.
 500:  38: 
 501:  39: 6. Extensible templates and “recipes”
 502:  40:    - Package common workflows by domain (e.g., SaaS app, analytics platform, mobile app) so teams can start fast and stay consistent.
 503:  41: 
 504:  42: 7. Secure by default
 505:  43:    - Role‑based access, write scopes, secrets hygiene, immutable logs, and compliance reporting baked into the process.
 506:  44: 
 507:  45: 8. Continuous learning
 508:  46:    - Capture feedback/errors/successes and roll up into prompts, rules, and future iterations.
 509:  47: 
 510:  48: ---
 511:  49: 
 512:  50: ## Overview of the AutoForge Operating Model
 513:  51: 
 514:  52: - Two‑world model: Human realm (docs/, api/, diagrams/, devops/, security/, qa/) vs AI realm (ai/ manifests, prompts, logs, memory, reports).
 515:  53: - Configuration drives behavior:
 516:  54:   - `autoforge.config.json` defines code targets and context overrides.
 517:  55:   - `npx autoforge configure` keeps managed YAML (ai/code_targets.yaml, ai/context_targets.yaml) synchronized.
 518:  56: - Observability by default:
 519:  57:   - Use `npx autoforge validate` to enforce quality gates.
 520:  58:   - Use `npx autoforge snapshot [path]` to generate REPO.md for sharing structure with assistants.
 521:  59:   - Maintain activity logs under `ai/logs/**` and short, durable memory in `ai/memory/**`.
 522:  60: 
 523:  61: ---
 524:  62: 
 525:  63: ## Roles and Collaboration
 526:  64: 
 527:  65: Baseline roles (customize per project via `ai/agents.yaml`):
 528:  66: 
 529:  67: - Discovery Researcher – Gather inputs and feasibility.
 530:  68: - Product Manager – Vision, PRD, acceptance criteria.
 531:  69: - Architect – Systems, diagrams, and API.
 532:  70: - Full‑Stack Engineer – Code/tests aligned to contracts.
 533:  71: - QA Engineer – Functional/regression testing and quality reporting.
 534:  72: - Security Engineer – Threat modeling, dependency checks, policy.
 535:  73: - DevOps Engineer – CI/CD, deployments, and runbooks.
 536:  74: - SRE – Observability, SLI/SLOs, alerts.
 537:  75: - UI/UX Designer – Wireframes, flows, style guide, a11y.
 538:  76: - Performance Engineer – Perf plans and scripts.
 539:  77: - Mastermind Coordinator – Orchestration, guardrails, and summaries.
 540:  78: 
 541:  79: Optional roles (add as needed):
 542:  80: 
 543:  81: - Integration Engineer – Third‑party APIs (payments, data providers, analytics).
 544:  82: - Payments Engineer – Billing/subscriptions, webhooks, reconciliation.
 545:  83: - Data Analyst – Dashboards, KPIs, insights.
 546:  84: - Compliance Officer – Audit trails, regulatory outputs.
 547:  85: 
 548:  86: Handoffs:
 549:  87: 
 550:  88: - Use the schema in `docs/MASTERMIND_PROMPTING_GUIDE.md` to exchange inputs, constraints, and deliverables.
 551:  89: - Enforce exit conditions and “max retries” to avoid infinite loops.
 552:  90: - If context is missing/invalid, halt and escalate—never guess.
 553:  91: 
 554:  92: ---
 555:  93: 
 556:  94: ## Human Checkpoints and Approvals
 557:  95: 
 558:  96: Design decisions that require explicit acknowledgment:
 559:  97: 
 560:  98: - Architecture deltas or new external integrations
 561:  99: - Touching `devops/**`, production deployments, or secrets
 562: 100: - Security findings, policy exceptions, or P0 regressions
 563: 101: - Large refactors or migrations
 564: 102: 
 565: 103: Implementation tips:
 566: 104: 
 567: 105: - Each prompt should surface a “STOP for approval” step before critical changes.
 568: 106: - Assistants should summarize risk, blast radius, and rollback strategy.
 569: 107: 
 570: 108: ---
 571: 109: 
 572: 110: ## Memory, Logging, and Auditability
 573: 111: 
 574: 112: - Persist key decisions in `ai/memory/ACTIVE_MEMORY.yaml` and update it at major handoffs.
 575: 113: - Write structured logs to `ai/logs/**` (consider a single `activity.jsonl` stream for session summaries).
 576: 114: - Store concise outcomes in `ai/reports/**` (e.g., kickoff, retrospectives, UI/UX updates).
 577: 115: - Keep `REPO.md` current with `npx autoforge snapshot [path]` for new collaborators/agents.
 578: 116: 
 579: 117: ---
 580: 118: 
 581: 119: ## Quality Gates (Default Set)
 582: 120: 
 583: 121: Common baseline checks (customize in `ai/context.manifest.yaml`):
 584: 122: 
 585: 123: - API contract present (e.g., `api/openapi.yaml` or planning stub)
 586: 124: - Architecture diagram(s) present (or planning stubs)
 587: 125: - Security readiness checklist present
 588: 126: - PRD present
 589: 127: - UI/UX style guide present
 590: 128: - Observability docs present (dashboards/alerts/SLOs)
 591: 129: - Optional: Tests present, CI config present, Performance plan/scripts present
 592: 130: 
 593: 131: Note: File paths are case‑sensitive. Ensure manifest entries match on‑disk filenames.
 594: 132: 
 595: 133: ---
 596: 134: 
 597: 135: ## Project Recipes (Assembly Line Templates)
 598: 136: 
 599: 137: Recipes define who does what, in which order, with which gates. Create one per domain or product family and store under `docs/blueprint/recipes/*.yaml`.
 600: 138: 
 601: 139: Example (generic):
 602: 140: 
 603: 141: ```yaml
 604: 142: name: default_web_app
 605: 143: stages:
 606: 144:   - id: idea_intake

 647: 185:       - ai/logs/deployments/*_deploy.md
 648: 186:     approvals: [human]
 649: 187: ```
 650: 188: 
 651: 189: Use recipes to seed `automation_bootstrap` behavior (select the recipe, expand steps, orchestrate prompts, enforce gates, and pause for approvals).
 652: 190: 
 653: 191: ---
 654: 192: 
 655: 193: ## Integrations and Plugins (API Ecosystem)
 656: 194: 
 657: 195: Standardize integrations so agents can propose, implement, test, and maintain connectors.
 658: 196: 
 659: 197: 1) Register providers in `ai/integrations.yaml`:
 660: 198: 
 661: 199: ```yaml
 662: 200: providers:
 663: 201:   stripe:
 664: 202:     env: [STRIPE_SECRET, STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET]
 665: 203:     sdks: ["@stripe/stripe-js", "stripe"]
 666: 204:     deliverables:
 667: 205:       - src/server/payments/**
 668: 206:       - docs/security/stripe.md
 669: 207:       - tests/payments/**
 670: 208:   analytics_provider:
 671: 209:     env: [ANALYTICS_KEY]
 672: 210:     sdks: ["analytics-sdk"]
 673: 211:     deliverables:
 674: 212:       - src/services/analytics/**
 675: 213:       - tests/analytics/**
 676: 214: ```
 677: 215: 
 678: 216: 2) Constrain write paths for new roles (e.g., `integration_engineer`, `payments_engineer`) in `ai/agents.yaml`.
 679: 217: 
 680: 218: 3) Require:
 681: 219: 
 682: 220: - Secrets only via environment variables
 683: 221: - Retries/backoff and error taxonomies
 684: 222: - Schemas and mocks/fixtures for offline tests
 685: 223: 
 686: 224: ---

 770: 308: 
 771: 309: ## Implementation Roadmap (Framework‑Level)
 772: 310: 
 773: 311: Use this backlog to evolve AutoForge itself so every project benefits.
 774: 312: 
 775: 313: - Now
 776: 314:   - Add default recipes under `docs/blueprint/recipes/` (web_app, analytics_app, mobile_app).
 777: 315:   - Introduce `ai/integrations.yaml` and new roles: `integration_engineer`, `payments_engineer`, `data_analyst`, `compliance_officer`.
 778: 316:   - Add STOP/APPROVAL steps + halt/exit conditions + max retries across role prompts.
 779: 317:   - Standardize `ai/logs/activity.jsonl` session summaries; document the format.
 780: 318: 
 781: 319: - Next
 782: 320:   - Add quality gates for “tests present” and “CI config present”.
 783: 321:   - Provide connector scaffolds (env, retries, schemas, mocks) for popular providers.
 784: 322:   - Seed a docs/observability package with example dashboards/alerts and SLO templates.
 785: 323: 
 786: 324: - Later
 787: 325:   - Optional UI assistant to review approvals and orchestrate multi‑agent runs.
 788: 326:   - Lightweight policy engine to enforce write scopes and sign off rules.
 789: 327:   - Pluggable analytics for agent performance and process optimization.
 790: 328: 
 791: 329: ---
 792: 330: 
 793: 331: ## Non‑Technical Path (From Scratch)
 794: 332: 
 795: 333: 1. Capture the idea
 796: 334:    - Run the Idea Conversation prompt (see docs/PROMPT_HANDBOOK.md) to interview on goals, audience, and risks.
 797: 335:    - The agent drafts/updates `ideas/` and a PRD stub.
 798: 336: 
 799: 337: 2. Approve the plan
 800: 338:    - Review PRD, high‑level architecture, and UI/UX sketches (wireframes/user flows/style guide).
 801: 339: 
 802: 340: 3. Orchestrate the build
 803: 341:    - Use a project recipe to guide the agent sequence with clear approvals.
 804: 342:    - Agents propose tests, security checklists, and observability from the start.
 805: 343: 
 806: 344: 4. Validate and deploy
 807: 345:    - Inspect QA and security reports; approve the deployment plan.
 808: 346:    - Receive a simple release summary and next‑step recommendations.
 809: 347:

 811: 349: 
 812: 350: ## Technical Path (From Scratch or Existing Codebase)
 813: 351: 
 814: 352: 1. Install and initialize
 815: 353:    - `npm install --save-dev @cojacklabs/autoforge`
 816: 354:    - `npx autoforge init`
 817: 355: 
 818: 356: 2. Configure
 819: 357:    - Update `autoforge.config.json` (codeTargets/contextTargets) to match your repo.
 820: 358:    - `npx autoforge configure`
 821: 359: 
 822: 360: 3. Load context and validate gates
 823: 361:    - `npx autoforge load` then paste the onboarding block into your AI tool.
 824: 362:    - `npx autoforge validate` and address missing gates (use planning stubs if needed).
 825: 363: 
 826: 364: 4. Snapshot (optional but recommended)
 827: 365:    - `npx autoforge snapshot` to create `REPO.md` for collaborators/agents.
 828: 366: 
 829: 367: 5. Orchestrate via prompts
 830: 368:    - Kick off with `automation_bootstrap`, then follow recipe‑driven handoffs.
 831: 369: 
 832: 370: ---
 833: 371: 
 834: 372: ## Security, Privacy, and Access Control
 835: 373: 
 836: 374: - Constrain agent write scopes in `ai/agents.yaml`.
 837: 375: - Keep `write_protect` rules for critical manifests and governance docs.
 838: 376: - Record immutable audit logs (timestamps, actor, action, path) and store under `ai/logs/**`.
 839: 377: - Enforce secrets via environment variables and rotate regularly.
 840: 378: 
 841: 379: ---
 842: 380: 
 843: 381: ## Continuous Learning and Improvement
 844: 382: 
 845: 383: - Aggregate session outcomes and feedback under `ai/logs/learning/`.
 846: 384: - Publish periodic summaries to `ai/reports/learning/` with action items (prompt changes, new gates, template updates).
 847: 385: - Refresh agent context with `npx autoforge load|refresh` after material changes.
 848: 386: 
 849: 387: ---
 850: 388: 
 851: 389: ## Quick Checklist (Any Project)
 852: 390: 
 853: 391: - [ ] Initialize AutoForge and configure targets
 854: 392: - [ ] Capture idea → PRD → diagrams → API draft
 855: 393: - [ ] Validate quality gates (allow planning stubs initially)
 856: 394: - [ ] Choose a recipe and run orchestration
 857: 395: - [ ] Enforce approvals at critical steps
 858: 396: - [ ] Generate code and tests inside declared targets
 859: 397: - [ ] Run QA, security, perf checks; fix findings
 860: 398: - [ ] Prepare deploy plan, execute, log results
 861: 399: - [ ] Update memory and retrospective
 862: 400: 
 863: 401: ---
 864: 402: 
 865: 403: ## Notes and Pitfalls
 866: 404: 
 867: 405: - Case sensitivity matters: ensure `ai/context.manifest.yaml` file paths exactly match on‑disk names.
 868: 406: - Keep prompts minimal but strict: define constraints, deliverables, and explicit stop/approval points.
 869: 407: - If a role needs new paths, update `ai/agents.yaml` and re‑validate before running prompts.
 870: 408: - Prefer planning stubs over blocking—just label clearly and route to approval.
 871: 409: 
 872: 410: ---
 873: 411: 
 874: 412: ## Adapting to Your Domain
 875: 413: 
 876: 414: Create or customize a recipe for your domain (e.g., fintech, healthcare, ecommerce, analytics, mobile). Define:
 877: 415: 
 878: 416: - Stages, owners (roles), deliverables, and quality gates
 879: 417: - Integration providers and required secrets
 880: 418: - Performance and observability budgets
 881: 419: - Security/compliance expectations (e.g., SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR)
 882: 420: 
 883: 421: Start simple; iterate with the agent network, and promote learned patterns into shared recipes for future projects.

1546: 50:   The kickoff prompt is primarily used when a human wants the agents to run a soup-to-nuts cycle,
1547: 51:   including UI/UX design. For day-to-day changes, prefer the change_request + impact_analysis
1548: 52:   workflow triggered via CI.
1549: 53:   - Call out any command that installs packages, runs migrations, or touches files outside the declared code targets so the human facilitator can approve before you proceed.
1550: 54:   - Update the active memory file with decisions, corrections, and follow-ups before handing off to the next agent.

1871: 26: **Current Progress**
1872: 27: 
1873: 28: - 2025-10-24: Initial public release of @cojacklabs/autoforge v0.1.0. Scoped package, added config-driven workflow (`autoforge configure`), planning-first quality gates, project snapshot (`autoforge snapshot`), and onboarding prompt generator (`autoforge load` / `refresh`).
1874: 29: 
1875: 30: **Upcoming / To Do**
1876: 31: 
1877: 32: 1. Announce the npm release across CoJack Labs channels and gather feedback.
1878: 33: 2. Monitor early adopters, capture issues/feature requests, and plan incremental patches.
1879: 34: 3. Expand automated smoke tests to install from the published tarball in CI.
1880: 35: 
1881: 36: ## Lessons Learned
1882: 37: 
1883: 38: - Use this section to capture durable insights after each cycle (architecture choices, vendor trade-offs, process tweaks). Keep bullets short and reference deeper artifacts in `ai/reports/`.
1884: 39: 
1885: 40: ## Agent Rules & Conventions (Living)
1886: 41: 
1887: 42: - Agents may update this section to record new working agreements that improve throughput or quality.
1888: 43: - Keep rules concise, actionable, and tool-agnostic so they carry over when switching IDEs/CLIs.
1889: 44: - When a rule changes behavior or scope, note the date and a one-line rationale.

2237: 102:   Operate relative to the repository root that contains this manifest. When AutoForge
2238: 103:   is cloned as a subdirectory (e.g., `custom-project/autoforge`), assistants must
2239: 104:   treat that folder as their working directory and avoid touching parent folders.
2240: 105: 
2241: 106:   The Mastermind Coordinator validates quality gates with scripts/validate_context.sh.
2242: 107:   Update include_globs or entrypoints whenever documentation moves; otherwise agents
2243: 108:   will raise context gap alerts. Keep governance assets under /docs, operational
2244: 109:   policies under /devops and /security, and leave /ai for manifests, prompts, logs,
2245: 110:   agent-generated reports, and shared memory snapshots.

2250:  1: # AI Directory
2251:  2: 
2252:  3: This folder defines AutoForge’s multi-agent workflow.
2253:  4: 
2254:  5: - `context.manifest.yaml` – Maps repository context and quality gates.
2255:  6: - `agents.yaml` – Declares roles (Product Manager, UI/UX Designer, Architect, etc.).
2256:  7: - `prompts/` – YAML prompts for each agent.
2257:  8: - `code_targets.yaml` – Managed file generated from autoforge.config.json (code locations for generated artifacts).
2258:  9: - `context_targets.yaml` – Managed file generated from autoforge.config.json (documentation overrides).
2259: 10: - `logs/` – Output from agent executions.
2260: 11: - `reports/` – Summaries (kickoff, change requests, retrospectives, UI/UX updates).
2261: 12: 
2262: 13: Before running prompts:
2263: 14: 
2264: 15: 1. Update `autoforge.config.json` (codeTargets/contextTargets) to match your project layout.
2265: 16: 2. Run `npx autoforge configure` so the managed `ai/code_targets.yaml` and `ai/context_targets.yaml` stay in sync.
2266: 17: 3. (First time or after upgrade) Run `npx autoforge load` and paste the generated prompt into your coding AI to reload rules, roles, `ai/AGENTS.md`, and memory.
2267: 18: 4. Operate from this directory when executing prompts (e.g., set working dir to `autoforge/`).
2268: 19: 
2269: 20: ## Applying configuration
2270: 21: 
2271: 22: Whenever you change `autoforge.config.json`, reapply it:
2272: 23: 
2273: 24: ```bash
2274: 25: npx autoforge configure
2275: 26: ```
2276: 27: 
2277: 28: This regenerates the managed YAML files and ensures every agent sees the latest project directories and documentation paths. Avoid editing files under `autoforge/ai/` directly—those are overwritten by the configure command.

2373:  2: 
2374:  3: Drop structured YAML files into this folder to trigger the change-management workflow.
2375:  4: Most of the time you can run `Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/change_intake.yaml` and let the Product Manager agent create the file for you.
2376:  5: 
2377:  6: - The agent clones `CR-0000_example.yaml`, increments the ID, and fills in the details from your conversation.
2378:  7: - If you prefer to work offline, copy `CR-0000_example.yaml` manually and update the metadata yourself.
2379:  8: - Each file should describe the change, impacted areas, acceptance criteria, rollback plan, and dependencies.
2380:  9: 
2381: 10: Once committed, the change-request workflow validates context and instructs you (via Chat Mode) to run the change request, UI/UX, and impact-analysis prompts.
2382: 11: 
2383: 12: ## Workflow tips
2384: 13: 
2385: 14: - Keep the assistant in `./autoforge` while you draft and review the YAML so planning artifacts stay scoped.
2386: 15: - When the engineer agent picks up the change, it should use the paths defined in `autoforge.config.json` (mirrored to `ai/code_targets.yaml`) for code/test edits and return here to log outcomes.
2387: 16: - Correct misunderstandings by editing the request file or replying with clarifications—the approval flow treats the YAML as the source of truth.
2388: 17: - Update the project memory file (`ai/memory/*.yaml`) with approved decisions, blocked items, and next actions before closing the request.
2389: 18: - Require commits to follow `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md`, including referencing the change request id in the message body.
2390: 19: - Decide on the semantic version bump (major/minor/patch) and update manifests accordingly before the final commit.

2605: ````markdown
2606:  1: # AI Agent Kickoff Instructions
2607:  2: 
2608:  3: Use this playbook when onboarding a code assistant (Codex, Claude Code, Gemini Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, etc.) so it can recognise the ROS AI agent network and initiate an autonomous development cycle.
2609:  4: 
2610:  5: ## Quick Start Message
2611:  6: 
2612:  7: Copy/paste one of the following into your assistant to load the essential context:
2613:  8: 
2614:  9: ```
2615: 10: # Standalone (AutoForge at repo root)
2616: 11: Read and follow:
2617: 12: - ai/context.manifest.yaml
2618: 13: - ai/agents.yaml
2619: 14: - ai/prompts/kickoff.yaml
2620: 15: 
2621: 16: Confirm when you have loaded all files, list the available entrypoints from the manifest,
2622: 17: and acknowledge readiness to run the kickoff sequence (Product Manager → Architect →
2623: 18: Full-Stack Engineer → QA → Security → DevOps → Retrospective). Do not code yet.
2624: 19: Review the latest memory file in ai/memory/ before proceeding.
2625: 20: ```
2626: 21: 
2627: 22: ```
2628: 23: # Embedded (AutoForge cloned into ./autoforge)
2629: 24: Read and follow:
2630: 25: - autoforge/ai/context.manifest.yaml
2631: 26: - autoforge/ai/agents.yaml
2632: 27: - autoforge/ai/prompts/kickoff.yaml
2633: 28: 
2634: 29: Confirm when you have loaded all files, list the available entrypoints from the manifest,
2635: 30: and acknowledge readiness to run the kickoff sequence (Product Manager → Architect →
2636: 31: Full-Stack Engineer → QA → Security → DevOps → Retrospective). Do not code yet.
2637: 32: Review the latest memory file in autoforge/ai/memory/ before proceeding.
2638: 33: ```
2639: 34: 
2640: 35: After the assistant acknowledges, instruct it to set the working directory to `./autoforge`
2641: 36: so all outputs remain inside the AutoForge folder.
2642: 37: Then confirm it has absorbed the active project memory so it continues from the latest state.
2643: 38: Before any staging or commits, direct the assistant to follow `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md`.
2644: 39: 
2645: 40: ## Repository Checklist
2646: 41: 
2647: 42: Ensure an idea exists before running kickoff (fill ideas/IDEA\_\*.yaml or run the discovery_researcher prompt). Then confirm these paths exist:
2648: 43: 
2649: 44: - `docs/blueprint/AGENTIC_BLUEPRINT.md`
2650: 45: - `docs/prd/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md`
2651: 46: - `api/openapi.yaml`
2652: 47: - `diagrams/*.mmd`
2653: 48: - `qa/tests.md`
2654: 49: - `security/SECURITY_READINESS.md`
2655: 50: - `devops/devops.yaml`
2656: 51: - `ideas/`, `research/`, and `change_requests/` for intake workflows
2657: 52: - `ai/memory/` with an active memory file tracking recent decisions and follow-ups
2658: 53: - `scripts/validate_context.sh` for quality gate verification
2659: 54: 
2660: 55: > When AutoForge is embedded in another project, these paths reside under `./autoforge/`.
2661: 56: 
2662: 57: Also review the managed `ai/context_targets.yaml` (or `autoforge/ai/context_targets.yaml`); if documentation lives outside the defaults, ask the human to update `contextTargets` in autoforge.config.json and rerun `npx autoforge configure`.
2663: 58: Also review the managed `ai/code_targets.yaml` (or `autoforge/ai/code_targets.yaml`) so the
2664: 59: engineering prompts know where to place application code and tests in your project.
2665: 60: 
2666: 61: ## How To Trigger
2667: 62: 
2668: 63: 1. Share the product vision and success metrics with the Product Manager agent (execute the kickoff prompt via your coding AI, using either `ai/prompts/kickoff.yaml` or `autoforge/ai/prompts/kickoff.yaml`).
2669: 64: 2. Allow the chain to progress through each role (Product Manager → UI/UX Designer → Architect → Full-Stack Engineer → QA → Security → DevOps → Retrospective). Each agent leaves artifacts in its designated directory.
2670: 65: 3. Review the retrospective in `ai/reports/` and issue GO/NO-GO.
2671: 66: 4. Append major decisions, corrections, and outstanding actions to the shared memory file (`ai/memory/*.yaml`) before ending the session.
2672: 67: 
2673: 68: For incremental work, use the change request workflow described in `docs/ai/CHANGE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md`.
2674: ````
2675: 
2676: ## File: docs/ai/CHANGE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md
2677: ````markdown
2678:  1: # Change Management Guide
2679:  2: 
2680:  3: This guide explains how to evolve the blueprint, code, tests, security posture, and CI/CD configuration using the autonomous agent network.
2681:  4: 
2682:  5: ## Two Ways to Trigger Change
2683:  6: 
2684:  7: 1. **Chat Mode (manual)** – Paste a structured prompt into your assistant.
2685:  8: 2. **File Mode (CI)** – Commit a file into `change_requests/` and let CI orchestrate the workflow automatically.
2686:  9: 
2687: 10: ## Option A — Chat Mode
2688: 11: 
2689: 12: Start by letting the Product Manager agent capture the request and create the YAML for you:
2690: 13: 
2691: 14: ```
2692: 15: Load ai/context.manifest.yaml and ai/agents.yaml.
2693: 16: Execute ai/prompts/change_intake.yaml with the details below.
2694: 17: ```
2695: 18: 
2696: 19: > If AutoForge lives under `./autoforge`, use `autoforge/ai/context.manifest.yaml`,
2697: 20: > `autoforge/ai/agents.yaml`, and `autoforge/ai/prompts/change_intake.yaml` instead.
2698: 21: 
2699: 22: Provide:
2700: 23: 
2701: 24: - Change summary (feature, bug, migration, knowledge share, etc.)
2702: 25: - Impacted users or systems
2703: 26: - Acceptance criteria
2704: 27: - Deadlines or release constraints
2705: 28: 
2706: 29: The agent will interview you, populate a new `change_requests/CR-XXXX_*.yaml` file,
2707: 30: and write a log under `ai/logs/change_intake/`.
2708: 31: Review the generated request, make edits if needed, then continue the workflow:
2709: 32: 
2710: 33: - Standalone: run `ai/prompts/change_request.yaml` → `ai/prompts/impact_analysis.yaml` → downstream prompts.
2711: 34: - Embedded: run `autoforge/ai/prompts/change_request.yaml` → `autoforge/ai/prompts/impact_analysis.yaml` → downstream prompts.
2712: 35: 
2713: 36: Remind the assistant to keep all modifications inside the AutoForge directory (set working directory to `./autoforge` for embedded usage).
2714: 37: 
2715: 38: If your project stores code/tests outside `../src` or `../tests`, update `codeTargets`
2716: 39: in `autoforge.config.json` and rerun `npx autoforge configure` before running the engineering prompts so they write to the correct locations.
2717: 40: 
2718: 41: ## Option B — File Mode
2719: 42: 
2720: 43: 1. (Optional) Manually copy `change_requests/CR-0000_example.yaml` if you prefer editing without Chat Mode.
2721: 44: 2. Fill in metadata, affected areas, and desired outcomes (or let the change_intake agent generate the file, then review/edit).
2722: 45: 3. Commit and push. `.github/workflows/agent-change-processor.yml` validates context and summarizes next steps.
2723: 46:    Ensure `contextTargets` in `autoforge.config.json` reflects any custom documentation paths (then run `npx autoforge configure`) before running prompts.
2724: 47: 
2725: 48: If the change introduces or modifies UI, include the UI/UX designer step:
2726: 49: 
2727: 50: - Standalone: add `ai/prompts/uiux_designer.yaml` after the Product Manager handoff.
2728: 51: - Embedded: `autoforge/ai/prompts/uiux_designer.yaml` prior to architectural analysis.
2729: 52: 
2730: 53: ## Workflow Overview
2731: 54: 
2732: 55: 1. **Mastermind Coordinator** logs the request.
2733: 56: 2. **UI/UX Designer** updates wireframes/style guide/user flows when UX changes are required.
2734: 57: 3. **Architect** runs `impact_analysis.yaml` to determine deltas.
2735: 58: 4. **Full-Stack Engineer** implements updates.
2736: 59: 5. **QA Engineer** validates and logs results.
2737: 60: 6. **Security Engineer** performs audits.
2738: 61: 7. **Performance Engineer** plans and executes load tests (as needed).
2739: 62: 8. **SRE Engineer** aligns SLOs/dashboards/alerts with the change.
2740: 63: 9. **DevOps Engineer** updates CI/CD and deployment plans.
2741: 64: 10. **Mastermind Coordinator** compiles the final report and requests human approval.
2742: 65: 
2743: 66: ## Best Practices
2744: 67: 
2745: 68: - Keep documentation accurate (blueprints, PRD, security policies, runbooks).
2746: 69: - Run `./scripts/validate_context.sh` before submitting change requests.
2747: 70: - Archive completed change reports in `ai/reports/`.
2748: 71: - Always include rollback and observability considerations for production-impacting changes.
2749: 72: - Maintain UI/UX artifacts in `docs/uiux/` so front-end engineers have clear implementation guidance.

2752: ## File: docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md
2753: ````markdown
2754:  1: # Commit & Command Playbook
2755:  2: 
2756:  3: Use this checklist whenever an agent is about to commit code, run automated tooling, or apply migrations. The goal is to make every change auditable, reproducible, and aligned with the human’s expectations.
2757:  4: 
2758:  5: ## Before you commit
2759:  6: 
2760:  7: 1. **Sync memory** – Review the active file in `ai/memory/` to confirm open tasks and risk notes.
2761:  8: 2. **Stage consciously** – Stage only files that belong to the current change request or bug fix. Leave planning artifacts (`ai/logs/**`, `ai/reports/**`) uncommitted unless the workflow explicitly asks for them.
2762:  9: 3. **Verify tests/linters** – Run only the commands required to validate the slice. Document which commands ran, their exit codes, and any artifacts produced.
2763: 10: 4. **Summarise in the log** – Update the current change request or memory entry with a short recap of what changed, tests executed, and known gaps.
2764: 11: 
2765: 12: ## Commit message rules
2766: 13: 
2767: 14: - **Format** – `type(scope): short imperative summary`
2768: 15:   - `type`: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, or `hotfix`
2769: 16:   - `scope`: folder or capability (e.g., `backend`, `ui`, `qa`)
2770: 17:   - Example: `fix(backend): handle missing customer billing id`
2771: 18: - **Body expectations**
2772: 19:   - Reference the change request, idea, or defect id that drove the work.
2773: 20:   - List user-facing effects or API changes.
2774: 21:   - Mention tests or scripts executed (e.g., `npm test -- ...`).
2775: 22:   - Capture follow-up tasks if the fix is partial.
2776: 23: - **One logical change per commit.** If the scope expands, split the work into separate commits or request human approval to squash.
2777: 24: 
2778: 25: ## Command execution protocol
2779: 26: 
2780: 27: 1. **Declare intent** – State the command, why it is needed, and expected outputs before running anything that mutates state (installs, migrations, formatters).
2781: 28: 2. **Use explicit working directories** – Planning commands run from `./autoforge`; code/test commands run in the directories defined in `autoforge.config.json` (mirrored to `ai/code_targets.yaml`).
2782: 29: 3. **Capture results** – Summarise command output in the log; save large logs under `ai/logs/**` rather than pasting into chat.
2783: 30: 4. **Rollback plan** – If the command fails or produces unexpected artifacts, describe how to undo the change or request human guidance.
2784: 31: 
2785: 32: ## Versioning diligence
2786: 33: 
2787: 34: Before the first commit in a change sequence:
2788: 35: 
2789: 36: 1. Inspect `package.json` (or the relevant manifest) and determine whether the work warrants a **major**, **minor**, or **patch** bump:
2790: 37:    - **major** – breaking API change, incompatible configuration, or migration that requires manual action.
2791: 38:    - **minor** – backwards-compatible feature, new endpoint, or UX addition.
2792: 39:    - **patch** – bug fix, dependency upgrade with no feature change, copy tweak.
2793: 40: 2. Update the version number following semantic versioning and stage the manifest alongside any generated lockfiles.
2794: 41: 3. Record the reasoning for the bump in the commit body (e.g., “Minor bump to 1.4.0 for dashboard filter feature”).
2795: 42: 4. If no bump is required (documentation-only change), explicitly state that rationale in the memory file and commit message.
2796: 43: 
2797: 44: ## Bug fixes vs. change requests
2798: 45: 
2799: 46: - **Change requests** – Follow `change_requests/README.md` and link commits to the request id (`CR-####`). Use the main kickoff or role-specific prompts.
2800: 47: - **Hotfix / bug fix** – For urgent defects, run `ai/prompts/hotfix.yaml`. It keeps scope tight, requires repro steps, and hands off to `fullstack_engineer`.
2801: 48:   - Commits from hotfixes should use the `hotfix` or `fix` type and include incident metadata in the body.
2802: 49:   - After the fix, update the memory file and schedule a retrospective run if the incident warrants one.
2803: 50: 
2804: 51: ## Human approvals
2805: 52: 
2806: 53: - Pause if a command needs elevated privileges, impacts environments beyond local development, or modifies files outside declared targets.
2807: 54: - Always summarise the planned commit before executing `git commit` so the human can veto or request edits.
2808: 55: - If multiple agents collaborate on the same slice, the Mastermind or coordinator is responsible for ensuring commit history stays clean and matches the documented plan.
2809: 56: 
2810: 57: By following this playbook, assistants remain transparent, predictable teammates and make handoffs between humans and AI frictionless.

2815:  1: # AI Orchestration Guide
2816:  2: 
2817:  3: This folder contains playbooks and guides for running AutoForge via AI coding tools.
2818:  4: 
2819:  5: - `AGENT_AUTONOMY_GUIDE.md` – How agents operate, required files, and working directory rules.
2820:  6: - `AGENT_KICKOFF_INSTRUCTIONS.md` – Prompt instructions for starting the full chain.
2821:  7: - `CHANGE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md` – How to submit and process change requests.
2822:  8: - `reviews/` – SDLC review documentation and improvement plans.
2823:  9: 
2824: 10: Agents and developers should reference this folder before running any prompts to
2825: 11: understand expectations, quality gates, and handoffs. For first‑time use or after upgrades, run `npx autoforge load` to generate a prompt that instructs your coding AI to reload rules, roles, `ai/AGENTS.md`, and the most recent memory file.
2826: 12: 
2827: 13: - Use `autoforge.config.json` for all customization. After editing, run `npx autoforge configure` so the managed `ai/code_targets.yaml` and `ai/context_targets.yaml` reflect the current settings. Avoid hand-editing files under `autoforge/ai/`.

2840:  3: ## Vision
2841:  4: 
2842:  5: Describe the end-to-end experience the ROS AI platform will deliver. Clarify the primary personas (investor, analyst, partner, admin) and the business outcomes we target.
2843:  6: 
2844:  7: ## Product Pillars
2845:  8: 
2846:  9: 1. **Discovery & Research** – Surface high-quality opportunities and contextual insights.
2847: 10: 2. **Due Diligence Automation** – Automate underwriting, document checks, and compliance workflows.
2848: 11: 3. **Execution Orchestration** – Coordinate stakeholders through the 14-stage assembly line.
2849: 12: 4. **Reporting & Analytics** – Provide live dashboards, alerts, and actionable intelligence.
2850: 13: 
2851: 14: ## Architecture Overview
2852: 15: 
2853: 16: - **Frontend**: Web client (React/Vite) consuming GraphQL/REST APIs, leveraging component primitives documented in `/src`.
2854: 17: - **Backend**: Service layer (Node/Express or Wasp) that implements domain logic, integrates third-party data providers, and exposes APIs defined in `api/openapi.yaml`.
2855: 18: - **Data**: PostgreSQL for transactional data, optional warehouse for analytics.
2856: 19: - **Infra/DevOps**: Containerized workloads deployed via GitHub Actions to cloud (e.g., GCP Cloud Run), with observability (logs, metrics, traces) wired through devops artifacts.
2857: 20: 
2858: 21: ## Governance
2859: 22: 
2860: 23: - Every feature flows through the agent chain defined in `ai/AGENTS.md`.
2861: 24: - Change requests originate in `change_requests/` and must pass QA, security, and DevOps gates.
2862: 25: - Documentation updates are part of the deliverable; agents cannot merge changes without updating the blueprint or PRD.
2863: 26: 
2864: 27: ## Current Status
2865: 28: 
2866: 29: Use this section to note active initiatives, open risks, or pending decisions. Update during each change request to keep the blueprint synchronized with implementation reality.

3140:  5: ## Keyboard Navigation
3141:  6: 
3142:  7: - All interactive elements reachable via keyboard (Tab / Shift+Tab).
3143:  8: - Visible focus indicators on links, buttons, form fields.
3144:  9: 
3145: 10: ## Color & Contrast
3146: 11: 
3147: 12: - Text contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 (body) and ≥ 3:1 (bold / large text).

3189: 20: 
3190: 21: ## Outputs / Handoff
3191: 22: 
3192: 23: The agent should:
3193: 24: 
3194: 25: 1. Reference each PRD feature and map it to UI components.
3195: 26: 2. Link UI states to relevant API endpoints.
3196: 27: 3. Provide implementation notes for front-end engineers (component structure,
3197: 28:    state management hints, etc.).
3198: 29: 4. Log summaries under `ai/reports/uiux/`.
3199: 30: 
3200: 31: ## Usage
3201: 32: 
3202: 33: When running the UI/UX Designer prompt, ensure:
3203: 34: 
3204: 35: - Working directory is set to the AutoForge folder.
3205: 36: - All generated artifacts remain within `docs/uiux/` or `ai/reports/uiux/`.
3206: 37: - Front-end engineers consult the managed `ai/code_targets.yaml` (generated from autoforge.config.json) to implement the designs in
3207: 38:   the host project’s codebase.
3208: 39: - Execute `ai/prompts/uiux_designer.yaml` (or `autoforge/ai/prompts/uiux_designer.yaml` when embedded) to populate and maintain these files.

3388: ````markdown
3389:  1: # Mastermind Prompting Guide
3390:  2: 
3391:  3: This guide standardises how agents exchange information through prompts and handoff payloads.
3392:  4: 
3393:  5: ## Master Prompt Schema
3394:  6: 
3395:  7: ```yaml
3396:  8: agent_role: "Architect"
3397:  9: objective: "Design database schema for underwriting module"
3398: 10: inputs:
3399: 11:   - docs/blueprint/spec.md
3400: 12:   - api/openapi.yaml
3401: 13: constraints:
3402: 14:   - Follow security policy in security/SECURITY_READINESS.md
3403: 15:   - Must support multi-tenant data separation
3404: 16: deliverables:
3405: 17:   - diagrams/data_model.mmd
3406: 18: handoff_to: "Full-Stack Engineer"
3407: 19: ```
3408: 20: 
3409: 21: ## Handoff JSON Schema
3410: 22: 
3411: 23: ```json
3412: 24: {
3413: 25:   "task_id": "CR-2025-08",
3414: 26:   "sender": "Architect",
3415: 27:   "receiver": "Full-Stack Engineer",
3416: 28:   "artifact_path": "api/openapi.yaml",
3417: 29:   "status": "complete",
3418: 30:   "timestamp": "2025-10-21T15:12:00Z"
3419: 31: }
3420: 32: ```
3421: 33: 
3422: 34: ## Communication Rules
3423: 35: 
3424: 36: 1. **Chain of Trust** – Each agent confirms previous deliverables before proceeding.
3425: 37: 2. **Atomic Tasks** – Break large requests into atomic deliverables; no partial handoffs.
3426: 38: 3. **Error Escalation** – If ambiguity remains, request clarification instead of guessing.
3427: 39: 4. **Transparency** – Log reasoning summaries in the deliverable or accompanying log file.
3428: 40: 5. **Approval** – Humans control GO/NO-GO decisions; agents must never override them.
3429: 41: 
3430: 42: ## Logging
3431: 43: 
3432: 44: - Mastermind activity → `ai/logs/mastermind/`.
3433: 45: - QA runs → `ai/logs/test_runs/`.
3434: 46: - Deployments → `ai/logs/deployments/`.
3435: 47: - UI/UX design sessions → `ai/logs/uiux/`.
3436: 48: 
3437: 49: Keep this guide updated so every assistant (Codex, Claude, Gemini, etc.) follows the same playbook.

3499:  58: - Quality gates
3500:  59: - Handoff file
3501:  60: - Fallback behavior
3502:  61: 
3503:  62: GitHub workflows monitor these triggers to maintain the loop automatically.
3504:  63: 
3505:  64: ---
3506:  65: 
3507:  66: ## 🧩 Key Implementation Additions
3508:  67: 
3509:  68: ### 1. Unified UI/UX Framework
3510:  69: 
3511:  70: Added `docs/uiux/` containing:
3512:  71: 
3513:  72: - `wireframes.md`
3514:  73: - `user_flows.md`
3515:  74: - `style_guide.md`
3516:  75: - `accessibility_guidelines.md`
3517:  76: 
3518:  77: These provide the visual and experiential foundation for all front-end generation tasks.
3519:  78: 
3520:  79: ### 2. Expanded `autoforge.config.json` (codeTargets)
3521:  80: 
3522:  81: Defines explicit directories for backend, frontend, and tests to ensure deterministic agent output. Regenerate the managed YAML with `npx autoforge configure` after editing.
3523:  82: 
3524:  83: ```json
3525:  84: {
3526:  85:   "codeTargets": {
3527:  86:     "backend": { "path": "../src/backend" },
3528:  87:     "frontend": { "path": "../src/frontend" },
3529:  88:     "tests": { "path": "../tests" }
3530:  89:   }
3531:  90: }
3532:  91: ```
3533:  92: 
3534:  93: ### 3. Folder-Level Prompt Guides
3535:  94: 
3536:  95: Every major folder (ideas, research, docs, qa, devops, ai) now includes a `README.md` or `.prompt.md` describing purpose and next steps.
3537:  96: → Converts AutoForge into a **self-documenting prompt ecosystem.**
3538:  97: 
3539:  98: ### 4. Example Lifecycle
3540:  99: 
3541: 100: `examples/fullstack_todo_app/` demonstrates the entire AI-driven workflow—from idea intake to retrospective report—providing training data for new users and agents.
3542: 101: 
3543: 102: ### 5. Validation Script
3544: 103: 
3545: 104: `scripts/validate_context.js` enforces the quality gates in `ai/context.manifest.yaml` before execution or PR merge.
3546: 105:

3921:  2: 
3922:  3: ## Overview
3923:  4: 
3924:  5: A responsive web application for small teams to manage tasks collaboratively. Includes basic task boards, assignments, due dates, and notes.
3925:  6: 
3926:  7: ## Functional Requirements
3927:  8: 
3928:  9: - User authentication (email/password).
3929: 10: - Task management CRUD.
3930: 11: - Assign tasks to teammates.
3931: 12: - Track due dates and completion status.

3940: 21: 
3941: 22: ## User Stories
3942: 23: 
3943: 24: - As a team lead, I can create tasks and assign them to members.
3944: 25: - As a team member, I can update status and add notes.
3945: 26: - As a user, I can filter tasks by status or assignee.
3946: 27: 
3947: 28: ## Dependencies
3948: 29: 
3949: 30: - Auth service
3950: 31: - Email service (future enhancement)
3951: 32: 
3952: 33: ## Next Steps
3953: 34:

3964:  5: summary: |
3965:  6:   Build a collaborative todo list app for small teams with task assignments, due dates, and completion tracking.
3966:  7: goals:
3967:  8:   - Improve task visibility for small teams
3968:  9:   - Provide lightweight collaboration compared to heavy project management suites
3969: 10: constraints:
3970: 11:   - Mobile friendly (responsive design)
3971: 12:   - Support up to 50 concurrent users (MVP)
3972: 13:   - Authentication via email/password
3973: 14: success_metrics:
3974: 15:   - 70% of beta users complete onboarding within 5 minutes
3975: 16:   - Daily active users > 30 within first month
3976: 17: assumptions:
3977: 18:   - Teams use email for coordination
3978: 19:   - Users want simple kanban-like workflow
3979: 20: notes: |
3980: 21:   Seed data and mocks acceptable for MVP; integrate real email later.

4002:  1: # Feasibility Brief – Team Todo App
4003:  2: 
4004:  3: ## Summary
4005:  4: 
4006:  5: - Market gap for small-team collaboration tools that are simpler than full PM suites.
4007:  6: - Users prioritized quick task entry, assignments, due dates, and basic progress tracking.
4008:  7: - MVP should focus on responsive web experience with email/password auth.
4009:  8: 
4010:  9: ## Key Findings
4011: 10: 
4012: 11: - Competitors (Trello/Asana) perceived as heavy for small teams; opportunity to differentiate on simplicity.
4013: 12: - Interviewees emphasized: due dates, reminders, ability to assign tasks to teammates.
4014: 13: - Real-time updates nice-to-have; can defer to Phase 2 (websocket support).
4015: 14: 
4016: 15: ## Risks
4017: 16: 
4018: 17: - Notification overload; start with simple daily digest.
4019: 18: - Data privacy considerations even for small teams (must use secure storage and HTTPS).
4020: 19: 
4021: 20: ## Recommendations
4022: 21: 
4023: 22: - Build React frontend with simple kanban board.
4024: 23: - Node/Express backend with REST API; Postgres for persistence.
4025: 24: - MVP feature set: tasks CRUD, assignments, due dates, notes, simple status.
4026: 25: 
4027: 26: ## Next Steps
4028: 27: 
4029: 28: - Update PRD with prioritized features and user stories.
4030: 29: - Proceed to blueprint and UI/UX design stages.

4043:  9: 
4044: 10: ## Methodology
4045: 11: 
4046: 12: - Competitive analysis (Trello, Asana, Todoist team plans).
4047: 13: - User interviews with 5 small teams (≤ 10 members).
4048: 14: - Technical feasibility review for real-time updates and notification requirements.
4049: 15: 
4050: 16: ## Data Sources
4051: 17: 
4052: 18: - Public reviews of competitor products.

4068:  1: # Example: Fullstack Todo App
4069:  2: 
4070:  3: This example illustrates how an idea flows through AutoForge from concept to deployment.
4071:  4: Use it as a reference when training your AI tooling or documenting new projects.

4075:  8: - `ideas/` – The initial idea template describing the Todo app.
4076:  9: - `research/` – Research plans and feasibility briefs.
4077: 10: - `docs/blueprint/` – Blueprint and architectural decisions for the app.
4078: 11: - `api/` – Todo-specific OpenAPI contract.
4079: 12: - `change_requests/` – Sample scoped change request.
4080: 13: - `qa/` – Test matrix tailored to the Todo app.
4081: 14: - `devops/` – Environment/deployment configuration for the example.
4082: 15: - `autoforge.config.json` (`codeTargets` section) – Ensure it points to your production code locations, then run `npx autoforge configure`.
4083: 16: - `ai/` – Logs and reports generated during the example run.
4084: 17:

4113:  2: 
4114:  3: Capture raw product ideas and initial prompts here.
4115:  4: 
4116:  5: - Use `IDEA_TEMPLATE.yaml` to define the problem, goals, and success metrics.
4117:  6: - Once an idea is documented, run the idea intake prompt to create a research plan.
4118:  7: - Store follow-up outputs in `../research/plans/` and `../research/briefs/`.
4119:  8: 
4120:  9: This folder anchors the starting point (Brainstorm) of the AutoForge SDLC pipeline.

4124: 13: - `autoforge/ai/prompts/discovery_researcher.yaml`
4125: 14: - `autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_intake.yaml`
4126: 15: 
4127: 16: ## Collaboration tips
4128: 17: 
4129: 18: - Discuss ideas with the assistant from inside `./autoforge` so interviews, notes, and drafts land in `ideas/` and `ai/logs/research/`.
4130: 19: - If the agent misinterprets the vision, update the idea file directly or provide inline corrections—subsequent prompts will treat the edited YAML as canonical.
4131: 20: - Before handing off to architecture or engineering, skim the captured logs to make sure the story reflects what you want built; adjust here before the downstream prompts begin.
4132: 21: - Summarize the final direction in the active memory file (`ai/memory/*.yaml`) so later sessions or different tools inherit the same context.

4144:  8: 
4145:  9: Before releasing a change, ensure:
4146: 10: 
4147: 11: 1. `tests.md` is updated with new scenarios or status changes.
4148: 12: 2. QA prompts produce logs and defect reports in these folders.

4945:  1: # Code of Conduct
4946:  2: 
4947:  3: We follow the Contributor Covenant to foster an open and welcoming community.
4948:  4: 
4949:  5: ## Our Pledge
4950:  6: 
4951:  7: We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
4952:  8: community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
4953:  9: size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
4954: 10: identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
4955: 11: nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity
4956: 12: and orientation.
4957: 13: 
4958: 14: ## Our Standards
4959: 15: 
4960: 16: Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
4961: 17: 
4962: 18: - Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
4963: 19: - Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
4964: 20: - Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
4965: 21: - Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and
4966: 22:   learning from the experience
4967: 23: - Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
4968: 24:   community
4969: 25: 
4970: 26: Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
4971: 27: 
4972: 28: - The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
4973: 29:   any kind
4974: 30: - Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
4975: 31: - Public or private harassment
4976: 32: - Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
4977: 33:   without their explicit permission
4978: 34: - Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
4979: 35:   professional setting
4980: 36: 
4981: 37: ## Enforcement Responsibilities
4982: 38: 
4983: 39: Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
4984: 40: acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
4985: 41: response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or
4986: 42: harmful.
4987: 43: 
4988: 44: ## Scope
4989: 45: 
4990: 46: This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when
4991: 47: an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public
4992: 48: spaces.
4993: 49: 
4994: 50: ## Enforcement
4995: 51: 
4996: 52: Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported
4997: 53: to the maintainers at support@cojacklabs.com. All complaints will be reviewed and
4998: 54: investigated promptly and fairly.
4999: 55: 
5000: 56: All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter
5001: 57: of any incident.
5002: 58: 
5003: 59: ## Attribution
5004: 60: 
5005: 61: This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org),
5006: 62: version 2.1.

5011:  1: # Contributing to @cojacklabs/autoforge
5012:  2: 
5013:  3: Thanks for your interest in contributing! AutoForge is an embedded, multi‑agent SDLC framework. This guide helps you get set up, make changes confidently, and submit high‑quality pull requests.
5014:  4: 
5015:  5: ## Quick start
5016:  6: 
5017:  7: - Fork the repo to your GitHub account
5018:  8: - Clone your fork locally and add the upstream remote
5019:  9: - Create a feature branch for your change
5020: 10: 
5021: 11: ```bash
5022: 12: git clone https://github.com/<you>/autoforge.git
5023: 13: cd autoforge
5024: 14: git remote add upstream https://github.com/cojacklabs/autoforge.git
5025: 15: git checkout -b feat/<short-topic>
5026: 16: ```
5027: 17: 
5028: 18: ## Dev setup
5029: 19: 
5030: 20: - Node.js 18+ recommended
5031: 21: - Install dev dependencies (already vendored in package.json)
5032: 22: 
5033: 23: ```bash
5034: 24: npm install
5035: 25: npm run build
5036: 26: ```
5037: 27: 
5038: 28: AutoForge is designed to live inside another project under `./autoforge`. During development, most changes are documentation, prompts, or CLI code in this repo.
5039: 29: 
5040: 30: ## Working philosophy
5041: 31: 
5042: 32: - Managed files: `ai/code_targets.yaml` and `ai/context_targets.yaml` are generated from `autoforge.config.json`. Do not hand‑edit them; instead:
5043: 33:   - Edit `autoforge.config.json`
5044: 34:   - Run `npx autoforge configure`
5045: 35: - Planning‑first: Quality gates accept canonical docs under `docs/`, `api/`, `diagrams/` or planning stubs under `autoforge/ai/reports/**`.
5046: 36: - Shared progress: Keep `ai/AGENTS.md` updated (Progress & Next Steps, Lessons Learned, Rules) so work transfers across IDEs/CLIs.
5047: 37: 
5048: 38: ## Local checks
5049: 39: 
5050: 40: Before opening a PR, please run:
5051: 41: 
5052: 42: ```bash
5053: 43: npm run build              # refresh dist/
5054: 44: npx autoforge configure    # regenerate managed YAML from config (if changed)
5055: 45: npx autoforge validate     # run quality gates
5056: 46: npm run format:check       # ensure code style
5057: 47: ```
5058: 48: 
5059: 49: Optional:
5060: 50: 
5061: 51: ```bash
5062: 52: npx autoforge load         # generate the copy/paste context prompt for your AI
5063: 53: npx autoforge snapshot     # write REPO.md (context snapshot) if relevant
5064: 54: ```
5065: 55: 
5066: 56: ## Commit guidelines
5067: 57: 
5068: 58: - Follow the conventional style and our playbook: see `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md`
5069: 59: - Scope examples: `feat(cli): add load subcommand`, `docs: clarify quality gates`
5070: 60: - Keep commits focused; include rationale and any semantic versioning implications
5071: 61: 
5072: 62: ## Pull request checklist
5073: 63: 
5074: 64: - [ ] Change is scoped and focused
5075: 65: - [ ] Docs updated (README, prompts, guides) when behavior changes
5076: 66: - [ ] `npm run build` passes; dist contains expected updates
5077: 67: - [ ] `npx autoforge validate` passes (if applicable)
5078: 68: - [ ] Linked to any related issue(s) or discussion
5079: 69: 
5080: 70: ## Finding issues
5081: 71: 
5082: 72: - Look for issues labeled `good first issue` (great for onboarding) and `help wanted`
5083: 73: - If you’re unsure where to start, open a Discussion or comment on an issue to coordinate
5084: 74: 
5085: 75: ## Code of Conduct
5086: 76: 
5087: 77: Participation in this project is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it to understand expected behavior.

5582: ````markdown
5583:  1: # Agent Autonomy Guide
5584:  2: 
5585:  3: This guide explains how the ROS AI agent network navigates and operates inside the repository.
5586:  4: 
5587:  5: ## Two-World Model
5588:  6: 
5589:  7: - **Human Realm** – Source-of-truth docs live under `docs/`, operational configs under `devops/`, security policies under `security/`, and product artifacts under `api/`, `diagrams/`, and `qa/`. When AutoForge is embedded in another project, these folders reside under `./autoforge/`.
5590:  8: - **AI Realm** – Manifests, prompts, and logs live under `ai/`. Agents never guess where context lives; they read `ai/context.manifest.yaml` for the canonical map.
5591:  9: 
5592: 10: > Application code/output paths are defined in `autoforge.config.json` and mirrored to the managed `ai/code_targets.yaml`. Ask the human to update the config and rerun `npx autoforge configure` before running engineering prompts.
5593: 11: > The same applies to documentation overrides: `ai/context_targets.yaml` is managed—coordinate any changes through `autoforge.config.json` + `npx autoforge configure`.
5594: 12: 
5595: 13: ## Entry Sequence
5596: 14: 
5597: 15: 1. Begin in the planning zone: set `cwd` to the folder that contains this guide (for embedded installs that is `./autoforge`).
5598: 16: 2. Read `ai/context.manifest.yaml` to discover context roots and quality gates.
5599: 17: 3. Review `ai/memory/ACTIVE_MEMORY.yaml` to absorb the latest decisions, corrections, and outstanding tasks. Always append new updates before ending a session.
5600: 18: 4. Consult and maintain `ai/AGENTS.md` (Progress & Next Steps, Lessons Learned, and Rules). Update it at each major handoff so humans and future tools have the same context.
5601: 19: 5. Load entrypoint files (`docs/blueprint/AGENTIC_BLUEPRINT.md`, `api/openapi.yaml`, etc.).
5602: 20: 6. Expand using `include_globs` while honouring `exclusions`.
5603: 21: 7. Validate quality gates via `scripts/validate_context.sh` when available.
5604: 22: 8. Switch to a build zone only when writing code/tests: consult the managed `ai/code_targets.yaml` (generated from `autoforge.config.json`), operate inside each declared `code_targets.*.path`, then return to the planning zone to update docs and logs.
5605: 23: 9. Record outputs to `ai/logs/` or the designated deliverable path and log every movement between planning and build zones in the activity notes. Update the memory file (`ai/memory/ACTIVE_MEMORY.yaml`) with new outcomes before handing off or ending the session; sync changes back to `ai/AGENTS.md` if the high-level progress shifts.
5606: 24: 
5607: 25: ### Approval cadence
5608: 26: 
5609: 27: - Mention any package install, migration, or long-running command before you execute it, including which directories it will modify.
5610: 28: - If you must touch a path that is not listed in the managed code targets or under the planning zone, pause and request human approval.
5611: 29: - Keep debugging commands scoped (e.g., `npm test -- some-pattern`), describe expected side effects, and revert back to the planning zone after they finish.
5612: 30: - Consult `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md` before staging commits or running stateful commands so outputs stay auditable.
5613: 31: 
5614: 32: ## Handoffs
5615: 33: 
5616: 34: - Agents communicate through structured prompts defined in `ai/prompts/`.
5617: 35: - Every handoff includes a JSON snippet (see `docs/MASTERMIND_PROMPTING_GUIDE.md`) capturing sender, receiver, artifact path, and status.
5618: 36: - If context is missing or invalid, agents do **not** forge ahead—they raise a context gap and notify the Mastermind Coordinator.
5619: 37: - UI/UX artifacts should be stored under `docs/uiux/` and summarized in `ai/reports/uiux/`.
5620: 38: 
5621: 39: ## Human Responsibilities
5622: 40: 
5623: 41: - Keep documentation up to date; the agents rely entirely on the files referenced in the manifest.
5624: 42: - Approve GO/NO-GO decisions, especially for production deployments or security findings.
5625: 43: - Review retrospectives in `ai/reports/` and schedule follow-up actions.
5626: 44: - Keep the active memory file in `ai/memory/` current so future sessions inherit the latest state.
5627: 45: - Enforce the commit/command rules documented in `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md` during reviews.
5628: 46: - Verify semantic version changes are applied (or explicitly waived) per the playbook before approving merges.
5629: 47: - Run `npm update @cojacklabs/autoforge || npx autoforge upgrade` periodically to pull upstream framework changes and rerun guardrails (local AutoForge edits are auto-stashed and restored).
5630: 48: - After updating, append a memory entry summarising new guidance and require agents to reload the manifests before resuming work.
5631: 49: - Ensure `contextTargets` in `autoforge.config.json` stays accurate and rerun `npx autoforge configure` so documentation references stay aligned.
5632: 50: - Maintain code target settings in `autoforge.config.json` (then rerun `npx autoforge configure`) so engineering agents place code and tests in the correct host-project locations.
5633: 51: - Use `ai/logs/uiux/` and `ai/reports/uiux/` to audit UI/UX decisions before engineering begins.
5634: 52: 
5635: 53: By maintaining clear boundaries and accurate context, we allow autonomous agents to handle the heavy lifting while humans steer vision and approval.
5636: 54: 
5637: 55: ## Context Snapshots
5638: 56: 
5639: 57: - Use `npx autoforge snapshot [path]` (run from the repo root, or from `./autoforge` and pass `..`) to produce `REPO.md` when sharing context with LLMs. Prefer the `context_snapshot` prompt when humans request help refreshing repository knowledge.
5640: 58: 
5641: 59: - Update `repomix.config.json` if you need to include/exclude additional folders when generating snapshots.

5645: ````markdown
5646:  1: # Prompt Handbook
5647:  2: 
5648:  3: Use these patterns when working with coding assistants (Codex, Claude Code, Gemini Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, etc.). Replace placeholders with your context.
5649:  4: 
5650:  5: ## 1. Describe the environment
5651:  6: 
5652:  7: ```
5653:  8: The AutoForge folder is located at ./autoforge. Treat that directory as your working root.
5654:  9: Code should be written to the paths defined in autoforge.config.json (mirrored to autoforge/ai/code_targets.yaml).
5655: 10: ```
5656: 11: 
5657: 12: ## 2. Load mandatory context
5658: 13: 
5659: 14: ```
5660: 15: Read the following files:
5661: 16: - autoforge/ai/context.manifest.yaml
5662: 17: - autoforge/ai/agents.yaml
5663: 18: - autoforge/ai/prompts/<agent>.yaml (as needed)
5664: 19: - For kickoff: autoforge/ai/prompts/kickoff.yaml
5665: 20: ```
5666: 21: 
5667: 22: ## 3. Explore the vision (high reasoning)
5668: 23: 
5669: 24: ```
5670: 25: Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_conversation.yaml
5671: 26: Partner with me on the product vision. Ask layered questions about user goals,
5672: 27: platform (web/mobile/desktop/framework), data, integrations, and delivery cadence.
5673: 28: Summarise decisions under ideas/ and ai/logs/ideas/.
5674: 29: ```
5675: 30: 
5676: 31: ## 4. Capture the vision (idea stage template)
5677: 32: 
5678: 33: ```
5679: 34: Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/discovery_researcher.yaml
5680: 35: Help me capture the project idea by asking targeted questions.
5681: 36: ```
5682: 37: 
5683: 38: ## 5. Create structured plans
5684: 39: 
5685: 40: ```
5686: 41: Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_intake.yaml
5687: 42: Using ideas/IDEA-2025...yaml and the discovery note, produce the idea intake plan.
5688: 43: ```
5689: 44: 
5690: 45: ## 6. Share repository context
5691: 46: 
5692: 47: ```
5693: 48: Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/context_snapshot.yaml
5694: 49: Run `npx autoforge snapshot` to regenerate REPO.md and brief me on the layout,
5695: 50: tech stack, and hotspots the next agents should prioritise.
5696: 51: ```
5697: 52: 
5698: 53: ## 7. Kickoff / Change flow
5699: 54: 
5700: 55: Refer to kickoff snippet in README or Quickstart. After kickoff, target prompts role-by-role (`Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/architect.yaml`, etc.).
5701: 56: 
5702: 57: ## 8. Record decisions
5703: 58: 
5704: 59: ``` 
5705: 60: Write a summary of this discussion to autoforge/ai/logs/research/...
5706: 61: Update ai/AGENTS.md (Progress & Next Steps, Lessons Learned) with the current status so any IDE/CLI can resume.
5707: 62: A: Save the session by appending the key updates to ai/memory/ACTIVE_MEMORY.yaml (follow the template). Confirm the file was written before ending the session.
5708: 63: ```
5709: 64: 
5710: 65: ## 9. Give go/no-go
5711: 66: 
5712: 67: ```
5713: 68: The idea is approved. Please begin the full kickoff sequence.

5719:   1: # AutoForge Quickstart (Embedded Mode)
5720:   2: 
5721:   3: Follow these steps to run AutoForge inside an existing project using Chat Mode.
5722:   4: 
5723:   5: Tip: For a broader, multi‑project overview (roles, approvals, automation features, and recipes), see `docs/AUTOFORGE_MULTI_PROJECT_GUIDE.md`.
5724:   6: 
5725:   7: ## 1. Install & Initialize
5726:   8: 
5727:   9: ```bash
5728:  10: npm install --save-dev @cojacklabs/autoforge
5729:  11: npx autoforge init
5730:  12: npx autoforge load   # emits a copy/paste prompt to train your AI on context + memory
5731:  13: ```
5732:  14: 
5733:  15: This scaffolds `autoforge/` in your repo and writes `autoforge.config.json`; runtime dependencies arrive with the npm package and the default configuration is applied so everything is ready for your coding assistant.
5734:  16: 
5735:  17: ## 2. Configure Paths
5736:  18: 
5737:  19: - Update `codeTargets` inside `autoforge.config.json` so backend/frontend/tests (and any extras) point at your project.
5738:  20: - (Optional) adjust `contextTargets` if PRD/blueprint/UI/UX docs live outside the defaults.
5739:  21: - After editing, run `npx autoforge configure` to regenerate the managed `ai/code_targets.yaml` and `ai/context_targets.yaml` files. Avoid hand-editing files under `./autoforge` unless directed by the framework.
5740:  22: 
5741:  23: ## 3. Capture the Idea
5742:  24: 
5743:  25: Start with a high-reasoning conversation when you want the agent to brainstorm options:
5744:  26: 
5745:  27: ```
5746:  28: Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_conversation.yaml
5747:  29: Let's explore the product vision, platforms, tech stack choices, integrations, and risks.
5748:  30: ```
5749:  31: 
5750:  32: When you have the basics, either fill `ideas/IDEA_TEMPLATE.yaml` manually **or** run:
5751:  33: 
5752:  34: ```
5753:  35: Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/discovery_researcher.yaml
5754:  36: Help me capture the vision for this project.
5755:  37: ```
5756:  38: 
5757:  39: Follow up with:
5758:  40: 
5759:  41: ```
5760:  42: Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_intake.yaml
5761:  43: Translate our notes into the structured idea plan for downstream agents.
5762:  44: ```
5763:  45: 
5764:  46: The agents write drafts under `ideas/` plus summaries under `ai/logs/`.
5765:  47: 
5766:  48: ### Seed shared memory
5767:  49: 
5768:  50: - Copy `ai/memory/MEMORY_TEMPLATE.yaml` to `ai/memory/ACTIVE_MEMORY.yaml` (or another descriptive name).
5769:  51: - Capture the latest decisions, corrections, and open questions after each working session.
5770:  52: - When you start a new Chat Mode run—or swap to a different coding agent—tell it to review the active memory file before continuing the work.
5771:  53: 
5772:  54: ## 4. Validate Quality Gates
5773:  55: 
5774:  56: ```bash
5775:  57: npx autoforge validate
5776:  58: ```
5777:  59: 
5778:  60: Quality gates accept either canonical docs under `docs/`, `api/`, `diagrams/` or planning copies under `./autoforge/ai/reports/**` (e.g., `autoforge/ai/reports/prd_stub.md`, `autoforge/ai/reports/openapi_stub.yaml`, `autoforge/ai/reports/diagrams/*.mmd`).
5779:  61: 
5780:  62: ## 5. Kick Off (Chat Mode)
5781:  63: 
5782:  64: Paste the block below into your coding assistant:
5783:  65: 
5784:  66: ```
5785:  67: Read and follow:
5786:  68: - autoforge/ai/context.manifest.yaml
5787:  69: - autoforge/ai/agents.yaml
5788:  70: - autoforge/ai/prompts/kickoff.yaml
5789:  71: 
5790:  72: While planning, stay inside ./autoforge for docs/logs.
5791:  73: When writing code/tests, use the paths defined in autoforge.config.json (mirrored to autoforge/ai/code_targets.yaml).
5792:  74: Confirm the latest idea in ideas/.
5793:  75: Run the kickoff sequence (PM → UI/UX → Architect → Engineer → QA → Security → Performance → SRE → DevOps → Retrospective).
5794:  76: Log outputs to autoforge/ai/logs/** and autoforge/ai/reports/**.
5795:  77: ```
5796:  78: 
5797:  79: ## 6. Change Requests
5798:  80: 
5799:  81: When you have a new feature, bug, migration, or knowledge share, run:
5800:  82: 
5801:  83: ```
5802:  84: Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/change_intake.yaml
5803:  85: Work with me to capture the request, fill in acceptance criteria, and create the change request file.
5804:  86: ```
5805:  87: 
5806:  88: The agent interviews you, clones `CR-0000_example.yaml`, and saves the populated request under `change_requests/`. Review/edit the generated file, commit, and follow the Chat Mode instructions posted by the GitHub Action.
5807:  89: 
5808:  90: > Guidance for humans & agents
5809:  91: >
5810:  92: > - Capturing ideas, refining change requests, and logging updates all happen inside `./autoforge`.
5811:  93: > - Keep the shared memory file in `ai/memory/` up to date; new agents should review it before acting.
5812:  94: > - Engineering prompts step out only through the code targets defined in `autoforge.config.json` (mirrored to `ai/code_targets.yaml`). Update the config and run `npx autoforge configure` before coding.
5813:  95: > - Agents should announce package installs, migrations, or debugging commands in advance so you can approve or redirect them.
5814:  96: > - Follow `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md` when staging commits or running impactful commands.
5815:  97: > - Confirm semantic version bumps in package manifests before the final commit; document the rationale in the commit body.
5816:  98: 
5817:  99: For single-issue bug fixes that cannot wait for the full change-request workflow, run `Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/hotfix.yaml` and follow the same memory/commit rules.
5818: 100: 
5819: 101: ## 7. Prompt Jumpstarts
5820: 102: 
5821: 103: - **Idea workshop** — `Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_conversation.yaml`
5822: 104: - **Share repo context** — `Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/context_snapshot.yaml`
5823: 105: - **Normalise change requests** — `Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/change_intake.yaml`
5824: 106: - **Route any request into automation** — `Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/automation_bootstrap.yaml`
5825: 107: 
5826: 108: Each prompt includes detailed instructions for the agent and where to record outputs.
5827: 109: 
5828: 110: ## 8. Snapshot the Project (Optional)
5829: 111: 
5830: 112: To create `REPO.md` for the host project:
5831: 113: 
5832: 114: ```bash
5833: 115: npx autoforge snapshot
5834: 116: ```
5835: 117: 
5836: 118: Run the command from the repo root to capture the current project, or append a path (for example, `npx autoforge snapshot ..`) to target another directory. The snapshot is a flattened context summary so AI tools can ingest the whole repository.
5837: 119: 
5838: 120: ## 9. Update AutoForge
5839: 121: 
5840: 122: When new framework updates land upstream, run:
5841: 123: 
5842: 124: ```bash
5843: 125: npx autoforge upgrade
5844: 126: ```
5845: 127: 
5846: 128: The CLI auto-stashes your `autoforge/` edits, applies the latest framework, and restores data directories (logs, memory, change requests). Resolve conflicts if Git raises any, rerun `npx autoforge validate`, log the upgrade in memory, and ask your coding assistant to reload the manifests/playbook.

5915:  24: 
5916:  25: This copies the framework into `autoforge/`, generates `autoforge.config.json`, and keeps the structure your agents expect. Runtime dependencies are already installed alongside the npm package, and the default configuration is applied automatically—rerun `npx autoforge configure` whenever you change the config.
5917:  26: 
5918:  27: ### Load context for your AI (first run)
5919:  28: 
5920:  29: ```bash
5921:  30: npx autoforge load
5922:  31: ```
5923:  32: 
5924:  33: This emits a copy/paste prompt (also saved under `autoforge/ai/logs/mastermind/`) to help your coding AI reload the rules, roles, progress log (`ai/AGENTS.md`), and the most recent memory file if present.
5925:  34: 
5926:  35: ---
5927:  36: 
5928:  37: ## 3. Configure once via autoforge.config.json
5929:  38: 
5930:  39: - Update `"codeTargets"` so backend/frontend/tests (and any extras) point to real directories in your project. After editing, run `npx autoforge configure` to regenerate the managed YAML files.
5931:  40: - (Optional) Adjust `"contextTargets"` if your documentation (PRD/blueprint/UI/UX) lives outside the defaults.
5932:  41: - Tweak feature flags or other overrides in `autoforge.config.json` as needed. Avoid editing files inside `autoforge/` directly—those folders are managed by the framework.
5933:  42: 
5934:  43: You’ve now told the agents where planning docs live and where to generate code.
5935:  44: 
5936:  45: ---
5937:  46: 
5938:  47: ## 4. Capture the idea (human ↔️ AI conversation)
5939:  48: 
5940:  49: AutoForge expects at least one idea file before kickoff.
5941:  50: 
5942:  51: - Start a high-reasoning conversation:
5943:  52:   ```
5944:  53:   Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_conversation.yaml
5945:  54:   Help me explore the application vision, platforms, tech stack options, and risks.
5946:  55:   ```
5947:  56:   The agent will interview you, propose stacks/integrations, and log the dialogue under `ai/logs/ideas/`.
5948:  57: - Copy `ideas/IDEA_TEMPLATE.yaml`, fill in the project vision, and save (e.g., `ideas/IDEA-0001_alpha.yaml`). **OR**
5949:  58: - Let the assistant interview you with a tight template:
5950:  59:   ```
5951:  60:   Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/discovery_researcher.yaml
5952:  61:   Help me capture the project idea by asking clarifying questions.
5953:  62:   ```
5954:  63:   The agent writes the filled template plus notes under `ai/logs/research/`.
5955:  64: 
5956:  65: Continue iterating with the assistant until the idea reflects what you want built.
5957:  66: When you have clarity, run `Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_intake.yaml` to convert the notes into a structured plan for the Assembly Line.
5958:  67: Record the most important decisions or clarifications in `ai/memory/` so future sessions inherit the same story.
5959:  68: 
5960:  69: ---
5961:  70: 
5962:  71: ## 5. Validate quality gates
5963:  72: 
5964:  73: ```bash
5965:  74: npx autoforge validate
5966:  75: ```
5967:  76: 
5968:  77: This enforces everything in `ai/context.manifest.yaml` (PRD present, diagrams exist, security checklist ready, observability docs, etc.). Quality gates now accept either the canonical docs under `docs/`, `api/`, `diagrams/` or planning-first copies under `./autoforge/ai/reports/**` (e.g., `autoforge/ai/reports/openapi_stub.yaml`, `autoforge/ai/reports/diagrams/*.mmd`). If something is missing, add the canonical file or a planning stub before moving on.
5969:  78: 
5970:  79: ---
5971:  80: 
5972:  81: ### Workspace boundaries & approvals
5973:  82: 
5974:  83: - Planning/logging: keep your assistant in `./autoforge` so ideas, research, and reports stay contained.
5975:  84: - Implementation: agents may only touch the host project through the code targets defined in `autoforge.config.json` (mirrored to the managed `ai/code_targets.yaml`). Update the config and rerun `npx autoforge configure` before coding.
5976:  85: - Elevated actions (package installs, long-running scripts, migrations) should be called out explicitly so the human reviewer can approve before execution.
5977:  86: 
5978:  87: ---
5979:  88: 
5980:  89: ### Guiding your AI teammate
5981:  90: 
5982:  91: - Kick off every session by pointing the agent at the latest `ideas/IDEA_*.yaml` entry and clarifying the goal in your own words.
5983:  92: - If the agent drifts or makes wrong assumptions, edit the relevant docs (idea, PRD, tech blueprint) or reply with corrections—AutoForge treats those files as the single source of truth.
5984:  93: - Remind the agent to log discoveries under `ai/logs/**` and summaries under `ai/reports/**` so you can audit each step.
5985:  94: - Use change requests when the scope shifts; the prompts walk the agent through impact analysis and give you checkpoints to accept or redirect work.
5986:  95: - Expect the agent to ask before running package installs, migrations, or touching files outside the declared targets—approve or deny explicitly to keep control of your repo.
5987:  96: - Keep an active memory file under `ai/memory/` up to date after each session; direct new assistants to review it before continuing work.
5988:  97: - Before staging commits or running stateful commands, have the agent review `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md` so history stays clean and reproducible.
5989:  98: - Confirm semantic version bumps (package.json, etc.) follow the playbook—major for breaking changes, minor for new features, patch for fixes.
5990:  99: 
5991: 100: ---
5992: 101: 
5993: 102: ## 6. Kick off with your coding AI
5994: 103: 
5995: 104: The kickoff prompt now confirms there is a current idea file before orchestrating
5996: 105: the Assembly Line. If none exists, it will instruct you to run `idea_conversation`
5997: 106: or drop a Markdown brief into `ideas/` so the agents can work autonomously.
5998: 107: 
5999: 108: Paste the snippet below into your coding assistant (Codex, Claude Code, Gemini Code, Cursor, etc.). This sets the stage for multi-agent handoffs.
6000: 109: 
6001: 110: ```
6002: 111: Read and follow:
6003: 112: - autoforge/ai/context.manifest.yaml
6004: 113: - autoforge/ai/agents.yaml
6005: 114: - autoforge/ai/prompts/kickoff.yaml
6006: 115: 
6007: 116: While planning: stay inside ./autoforge for docs/logs.
6008: 117: When writing code/tests: use the paths defined in autoforge.config.json (mirrored to autoforge/ai/code_targets.yaml).
6009: 118: Confirm the latest idea in ideas/.
6010: 119: Run the kickoff sequence (Product Manager → UI/UX → Architect → Engineer → QA → Security → Performance → SRE → DevOps → Retrospective).
6011: 120: Log outputs to autoforge/ai/logs/** and autoforge/ai/reports/**.
6012: 121: ```
6013: 122: 
6014: 123: ### Follow-up prompts
6015: 124: 
6016: 125: After kickoff completes you can continue agent-by-agent:
6017: 126: 
6018: 127: - `Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/architect.yaml`
6019: 128: - `Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/fullstack_engineer.yaml`
6020: 129: - … and so on down the chain.
6021: 130: 
6022: 131: Refer to [docs/prompt_handbook.md](docs/prompt_handbook.md) for ready-made snippet patterns.
6023: 132: 
6024: 133: ---
6025: 134: 
6026: 135: ## 7. Prompt jumpstarts (copy/paste ready)
6027: 136: 
6028: 137: - **Idea workshop (AI agent interview)**
6029: 138:   ```
6030: 139:   Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_conversation.yaml
6031: 140:   Partner with me on the product vision. Ask layered questions about audience,
6032: 141:   platform (web/mobile/desktop/framework), tech stack options, third-party integrations,
6033: 142:   delivery cadence, and risks. Summarize decisions in ideas/ and ai/logs/ideas/.
6034: 143:   ```
6035: 144: - **Share the current project context**
6036: 145:   ```
6037: 146:   Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/context_snapshot.yaml
6038: 147:   Generate a fresh REPO.md snapshot of the host project with `npx autoforge snapshot`.
6039: 148:   Highlight notable directories, recent changes, and any risks downstream agents should know.
6040: 149:   ```
6041: 150: - **Intake a structured change request**
6042: 151:   ```
6043: 152:   Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/change_intake.yaml
6044: 153:   I have a change request (feature/bug/migration/knowledge share).
6045: 154:   Interview me, capture acceptance criteria, and create the change_requests/ record and intake log.
6046: 155:   ```
6047: 156: - **Route any engagement into the SDLC Assembly Line**
6048: 157:   ```
6049: 158:   Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/automation_bootstrap.yaml
6050: 159:   Diagnose whether I need a new build, help on an existing codebase, a migration, or troubleshooting.
6051: 160:   Offer a fully autonomous plan; once I approve, trigger the right prompts (kickoff, change intake, context snapshot, etc.).
6052: 161:   ```
6053: 162: 
6054: 163: ---
6055: 164: 
6056: 165: ## 8. Change request workflow (human ↔️ AI loop)
6057: 166: 
6058: 167: 1. Tell the assistant what needs to change:
6059: 168:    ```
6060: 169:    Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/change_intake.yaml
6061: 170:    I need help with <feature|bug|migration|knowledge share>.
6062: 171:    Ask follow-up questions, create the change request file for me, and log any open issues.
6063: 172:    ```
6064: 173:    The agent interviews you, clones `CR-0000_example.yaml`, and saves a populated record under `change_requests/`.
6065: 174: 2. Review or edit the generated change request if needed, then commit/push. The GitHub Action validates and posts instructions in the run summary.
6066: 175: 3. In Chat Mode, run the prompts in order:
6067: 176:    - `Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/change_request.yaml`
6068: 177:    - (If UX involved) `Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/uiux_designer.yaml`
6069: 178:    - `Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/impact_analysis.yaml`
6070: 179:    - Follow the chain (Fullstack → QA → Security → Performance → SRE → DevOps → Retrospective)
6071: 180: 4. Record outputs to the paths defined in each prompt (`ai/logs/**`, `ai/reports/**`, etc.).
6072: 181: 
6073: 182: > Urgent defect? Run `Execute autoforge/ai/prompts/hotfix.yaml` instead. It keeps the scope to a single bug, enforces reproducibility, and still requires you to follow the commit rules in `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md`.
6074: 183: 
6075: 184: ---
6076: 185: 
6077: 186: ## 9. Stage gate checklist
6078: 187: 
6079: 188: Tick these items before shipping a slice:
6080: 189: 
6081: 190: - ✔ Idea: `autoforge/ideas/IDEA_*.yaml`
6082: 191: - ✔ UI/UX: `autoforge/docs/uiux/style_guide.md`, `wireframes.md`, `user_flows.md`, `accessibility_guidelines.md`, `ai/reports/uiux/*.md`
6083: 192: - ✔ Architecture: `autoforge/docs/blueprint/*.md`, `autoforge/diagrams/*.mmd`, `autoforge/api/openapi.yaml`
6084: 193: - ✔ Engineering outputs: code targets from `autoforge.config.json` (mirrored to `autoforge/ai/code_targets.yaml`) contain new code (`../src/backend`, `../src/frontend`, `../tests` by default)
6085: 194: - ✔ QA: `autoforge/ai/logs/test_runs/latest_report.md`, `autoforge/qa/reports/defects.md`
6086: 195: - ✔ Security: `autoforge/security/reports/security_audit.md`, `autoforge/security/reports/findings.json`
6087: 196: - ✔ Performance: `autoforge/docs/perf/plan.md`, `autoforge/docs/perf/scripts/*`, `autoforge/ai/reports/perf/*.md`
6088: 197: - ✔ Observability: `autoforge/docs/observability/dashboards.md`, `alerts.md`, `slo.md`, `autoforge/ai/reports/observability/*.md`
6089: 198: - ✔ DevOps: `autoforge/devops/runbooks/deploy.md`, `autoforge/ai/logs/deployments/*_deploy.md`
6090: 199: - ✔ Retrospective: `autoforge/ai/reports/retrospective_*.md`
6091: 200: - ✔ Versioning: package manifests bumped per docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md and rationale captured in commits/memory.
6092: 201: 
6093: 202: ---
6094: 203: 
6095: 204: ## 10. Demo slice (optional)
6096: 205: 
6097: 206: Need a sample to test? Update `codeTargets` in `autoforge.config.json` (then run `npx autoforge configure`) to point at the demo directories and try:
6098: 207: 
6099: 208: - `examples/fullstack_todo_app/demo_src/backend/server.js`
6100: 209: - `examples/fullstack_todo_app/demo_src/frontend/index.html`
6101: 210: - `node --test examples/fullstack_todo_app/demo_src/tests/todo.test.js`
6102: 211: 
6103: 212: CI already runs this example as part of `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
6104: 213: 
6105: 214: ---
6106: 215: 
6107: 216: ## 11. Generate repository snapshot (optional)
6108: 217: 
6109: 218: From your project root (or to targeted `<path`> for safe keeping):
6110: 219: 
6111: 220: ```bash
6112: 221: npx autoforge snapshot <path>        # writes REPO.md next to the folder you target
6113: 222: ```
6114: 223: 
6115: 224: The generated `REPO.md` makes it easy to share the entire codebase with an AI model.
6116: 225: 
6117: 226: ---
6118: 227: 
6119: 228: ## 12. Update AutoForge
6120: 229: 
6121: 230: ```bash
6122: 231: npx autoforge upgrade
6123: 232: ```
6124: 233: 
6125: 234: The CLI auto-stashes any local changes inside `autoforge/`, applies the latest framework snapshot, and restores your data directories (`ai/memory`, `ai/logs`, `change_requests`, etc.). If Git reports conflicts, resolve them, then rerun `npx autoforge validate`.
6126: 235: 
6127: 236: After upgrading:
6128: 237: 
6129: 238: - Note the change in your active memory file so the next session knows which rules changed.
6130: 239: - Tell your assistant to reload `autoforge/ai/context.manifest.yaml`, `autoforge/ai/agents.yaml`, and `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md`.
6131: 240: 
6132: 241: ---
6133: 242: 
6134: 243: ## 13. CLI reference
6135: 244: 
6136: 245: - `autoforge init [--force]` — scaffold or refresh `./autoforge/` and create `autoforge.config.json`.
6137: 246: - `autoforge upgrade` — replace framework-managed files while preserving logs, memory, ideas, and change requests.
6138: 247: - `autoforge configure` — regenerate managed files (ai/code_targets.yaml, ai/context_targets.yaml) from `autoforge.config.json`.
6139: 248: - `autoforge load` — emit a copy/paste prompt (and log to ai/logs/mastermind/) that instructs your AI tool to reload rules, roles, progress, and memory from the latest context and most recent memory. Alias: `autoforge refresh`.
6140: 249: - `autoforge validate` — runs the quality gate checks.
6141: 250: - `autoforge doctor` — verifies required files and config are present.
6142: 251: - `autoforge version` — prints the installed package version.
6143: 252: 
6144: 253: Need framework commands from inside CI or scripts? Prefix with `npx` (e.g., `npx autoforge validate`).

24: ## Progress & Next Steps
25: 
26: **Current Progress**
27: 
28: - 2025-10-24: Initial public release of @cojacklabs/autoforge v0.1.0. Scoped package, added config-driven workflow (`autoforge configure`), planning-first quality gates, project snapshot (`autoforge snapshot`), and onboarding prompt generator (`autoforge load` / `refresh`).
29: - 2025-10-28: v0.2.0 updates in progress. Default folder renamed to `.autoforge/` (legacy `autoforge/` still supported), STOP/APPROVAL gates with `max_retries` added across prompts, recipe-based orchestration (`docs/blueprint/recipes/*` + `automation_bootstrap`), integration registry (`ai/integrations.yaml`), and new optional roles (integration_engineer, payments_engineer, data_analyst, compliance_officer). Agents should reload manifests and follow the updated approvals cadence.
30: 
31: **Upcoming / To Do**
32: 
33: 1. Publish v0.2.0 notes, update `README`/`QUICKSTART` links, and collect adopter feedback.
34: 2. Wire recipes into automation flows end-to-end and add example CI configs per recipe.
35: 3. Expand validator to enforce new gates and optional role deliverables.
36: 
37: ## Lessons Learned

41: ## Agent Rules & Conventions (Living)
42: 
43: - Agents may update this section to record new working agreements that improve throughput or quality.
44: - Keep rules concise, actionable, and tool-agnostic so they carry over when switching IDEs/CLIs.
45: - When a rule changes behavior or scope, note the date and a one-line rationale.

 1: # AI Directory
 2: 
 3: This folder defines AutoForge’s multi-agent workflow.
 4: 
 5: - `context.manifest.yaml` – Maps repository context and quality gates.
 6: - `agents.yaml` – Declares roles (Product Manager, UI/UX Designer, Architect, etc.).
 7: - `prompts/` – YAML prompts for each agent.
 8: - `code_targets.yaml` – Managed file generated from autoforge.config.json (code locations for generated artifacts).
 9: - `context_targets.yaml` – Managed file generated from autoforge.config.json (documentation overrides).
10: - `logs/` – Output from agent executions.
11: - `reports/` – Summaries (kickoff, change requests, retrospectives, UI/UX updates).
12: 
13: Before running prompts:
14: 
15: 1. Update `autoforge.config.json` (codeTargets/contextTargets) to match your project layout.
16: 2. Run `npx autoforge configure` so the managed `ai/code_targets.yaml` and `ai/context_targets.yaml` stay in sync.
17: 3. (First time or after upgrade) Run `npx autoforge load` and paste the generated prompt into your coding AI to reload rules, roles, `ai/AGENTS.md`, and memory.
18: 4. Operate from this directory when executing prompts (e.g., set working dir to `.autoforge/`).
19: 
20: ## Applying configuration
21: 
22: Whenever you change `autoforge.config.json`, reapply it:
23: 
24: ```bash
25: npx autoforge configure
26: ```
27: 
28: This regenerates the managed YAML files and ensures every agent sees the latest project directories and documentation paths. Avoid editing files under `.autoforge/ai/` directly—those are overwritten by the configure command.

## File: change_requests/README.md

 1: # Change Requests
 2: 
 3: Drop structured YAML files into this folder to trigger the change-management workflow.
 4: Most of the time you can run `Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/change_intake.yaml` and let the Product Manager agent create the file for you.
 5: 
 6: - The agent clones `CR-0000_example.yaml`, increments the ID, and fills in the details from your conversation.
 7: - If you prefer to work offline, copy `CR-0000_example.yaml` manually and update the metadata yourself.
 8: - Each file should describe the change, impacted areas, acceptance criteria, rollback plan, and dependencies.
 9: 
10: Once committed, the change-request workflow validates context and instructs you (via Chat Mode) to run the change request, UI/UX, and impact-analysis prompts.
11: 
12: ## Workflow tips
13: 
14: - Keep the assistant in `./autoforge` while you draft and review the YAML so planning artifacts stay scoped.
15: - When the engineer agent picks up the change, it should use the paths defined in `autoforge.config.json` (mirrored to `ai/code_targets.yaml`) for code/test edits and return here to log outcomes.
16: - Correct misunderstandings by editing the request file or replying with clarifications—the approval flow treats the YAML as the source of truth.
17: - Update the project memory file (`ai/memory/*.yaml`) with approved decisions, blocked items, and next actions before closing the request.
18: - Require commits to follow `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md`, including referencing the change request id in the message body.
19: - Decide on the semantic version bump (major/minor/patch) and update manifests accordingly before the final commit.

## File: docs/ai/AGENT_KICKOFF_INSTRUCTIONS.md
`````markdown
 1: # AI Agent Kickoff Instructions
 2: 
 3: Use this playbook when onboarding a code assistant (Codex, Claude Code, Gemini Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, etc.) so it can recognise the ROS AI agent network and initiate an autonomous development cycle.
 4: 
 5: ## Quick Start Message
 6: 
 7: Copy/paste one of the following into your assistant to load the essential context:
 8: 
 9: ```
10: # Standalone (AutoForge at repo root)
11: Read and follow:
12: - ai/context.manifest.yaml
13: - ai/agents.yaml
14: - ai/prompts/kickoff.yaml
15: 
16: Confirm when you have loaded all files, list the available entrypoints from the manifest,
17: and acknowledge readiness to run the kickoff sequence (Product Manager → Architect →
18: Full-Stack Engineer → QA → Security → DevOps → Retrospective). Do not code yet.
19: Review the latest memory file in ai/memory/ before proceeding.
20: ```
21: 
22: ```
23: # Embedded (AutoForge cloned into ./.autoforge)
24: Read and follow:
25: - .autoforge/ai/context.manifest.yaml
26: - .autoforge/ai/agents.yaml
27: - .autoforge/ai/prompts/kickoff.yaml
28: 
29: Confirm when you have loaded all files, list the available entrypoints from the manifest,
30: and acknowledge readiness to run the kickoff sequence (Product Manager → Architect →
31: Full-Stack Engineer → QA → Security → DevOps → Retrospective). Do not code yet.
32: Review the latest memory file in .autoforge/ai/memory/ before proceeding.
33: ```
34: 
35: After the assistant acknowledges, instruct it to set the working directory to `./.autoforge`
36: so all outputs remain inside the AutoForge folder.
37: Then confirm it has absorbed the active project memory so it continues from the latest state.
38: Before any staging or commits, direct the assistant to follow `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md`.
39: 
40: ## Repository Checklist
41: 
42: Ensure an idea exists before running kickoff (fill ideas/IDEA\_\*.yaml or run the discovery_researcher prompt). Then confirm these paths exist:
43: 
44: - `docs/blueprint/AGENTIC_BLUEPRINT.md`
45: - `docs/prd/PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md`
46: - `api/openapi.yaml`
47: - `diagrams/*.mmd`
48: - `qa/tests.md`
49: - `security/SECURITY_READINESS.md`
50: - `devops/devops.yaml`
51: - `ideas/`, `research/`, and `change_requests/` for intake workflows
52: - `ai/memory/` with an active memory file tracking recent decisions and follow-ups
53: - `scripts/validate_context.sh` for quality gate verification
54: 
55: > When AutoForge is embedded in another project, these paths reside under `./.autoforge/` (legacy: `./autoforge/`).
56: 
57: Also review the managed `ai/context_targets.yaml` (or `.autoforge/ai/context_targets.yaml`); if documentation lives outside the defaults, ask the human to update `contextTargets` in autoforge.config.json and rerun `npx autoforge configure`.
58: Also review the managed `ai/code_targets.yaml` (or `.autoforge/ai/code_targets.yaml`) so the
59: engineering prompts know where to place application code and tests in your project.
60: 
61: ## How To Trigger
62: 
63: 1. Share the product vision and success metrics with the Product Manager agent (execute the kickoff prompt via your coding AI, using either `ai/prompts/kickoff.yaml` or `.autoforge/ai/prompts/kickoff.yaml`).
64: 2. Allow the chain to progress through each role (Product Manager → UI/UX Designer → Architect → Full-Stack Engineer → QA → Security → DevOps → Retrospective). Each agent leaves artifacts in its designated directory.
65: 3. Review the retrospective in `ai/reports/` and issue GO/NO-GO.
66: 4. Append major decisions, corrections, and outstanding actions to the shared memory file (`ai/memory/*.yaml`) before ending the session.
67: 
68: For incremental work, use the change request workflow described in `docs/ai/CHANGE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md`.
`````

## File: docs/ai/CHANGE_MANAGEMENT_GUIDE.md
`````markdown
 1: # Change Management Guide
 2: 
 3: This guide explains how to evolve the blueprint, code, tests, security posture, and CI/CD configuration using the autonomous agent network.
 4: 
 5: ## Two Ways to Trigger Change
 6: 
 7: 1. **Chat Mode (manual)** – Paste a structured prompt into your assistant.
 8: 2. **File Mode (CI)** – Commit a file into `change_requests/` and let CI orchestrate the workflow automatically.
 9: 
10: ## Option A — Chat Mode
11: 
12: Start by letting the Product Manager agent capture the request and create the YAML for you:
13: 
14: ```
15: Load ai/context.manifest.yaml and ai/agents.yaml.
16: Execute ai/prompts/change_intake.yaml with the details below.
17: ```
18: 
19: > If AutoForge lives under `./.autoforge`, use `.autoforge/ai/context.manifest.yaml`,
20: > `.autoforge/ai/agents.yaml`, and `.autoforge/ai/prompts/change_intake.yaml` instead.
21: 
22: Provide:
23: 
24: - Change summary (feature, bug, migration, knowledge share, etc.)
25: - Impacted users or systems
26: - Acceptance criteria
27: - Deadlines or release constraints
28: 
29: The agent will interview you, populate a new `change_requests/CR-XXXX_*.yaml` file,
30: and write a log under `ai/logs/change_intake/`.
31: Review the generated request, make edits if needed, then continue the workflow:
32: 
33: - Standalone: run `ai/prompts/change_request.yaml` → `ai/prompts/impact_analysis.yaml` → downstream prompts.
34: - Embedded: run `.autoforge/ai/prompts/change_request.yaml` → `.autoforge/ai/prompts/impact_analysis.yaml` → downstream prompts.
35: 
36: Remind the assistant to keep all modifications inside the AutoForge directory (set working directory to `./autoforge` for embedded usage).
37: 
38: If your project stores code/tests outside `../src` or `../tests`, update `codeTargets`
39: in `autoforge.config.json` and rerun `npx autoforge configure` before running the engineering prompts so they write to the correct locations.
40: 
41: ## Option B — File Mode
42: 
43: 1. (Optional) Manually copy `change_requests/CR-0000_example.yaml` if you prefer editing without Chat Mode.
44: 2. Fill in metadata, affected areas, and desired outcomes (or let the change_intake agent generate the file, then review/edit).
45: 3. Commit and push. `.github/workflows/agent-change-processor.yml` validates context and summarizes next steps.
46:    Ensure `contextTargets` in `autoforge.config.json` reflects any custom documentation paths (then run `npx autoforge configure`) before running prompts.
47: 
48: If the change introduces or modifies UI, include the UI/UX designer step:
49: 
50: - Standalone: add `ai/prompts/uiux_designer.yaml` after the Product Manager handoff.
51: - Embedded: `.autoforge/ai/prompts/uiux_designer.yaml` prior to architectural analysis.
52: 
53: ## Workflow Overview
54: 
55: 1. **Mastermind Coordinator** logs the request.
56: 2. **UI/UX Designer** updates wireframes/style guide/user flows when UX changes are required.
57: 3. **Architect** runs `impact_analysis.yaml` to determine deltas.
58: 4. **Full-Stack Engineer** implements updates.
59: 5. **QA Engineer** validates and logs results.
60: 6. **Security Engineer** performs audits.
61: 7. **Performance Engineer** plans and executes load tests (as needed).
62: 8. **SRE Engineer** aligns SLOs/dashboards/alerts with the change.
63: 9. **DevOps Engineer** updates CI/CD and deployment plans.
64: 10. **Mastermind Coordinator** compiles the final report and requests human approval.
65: 
66: ## Best Practices
67: 
68: - Keep documentation accurate (blueprints, PRD, security policies, runbooks).
69: - Run `./scripts/validate_context.sh` before submitting change requests.
70: - Archive completed change reports in `ai/reports/`.
71: - Always include rollback and observability considerations for production-impacting changes.
72: - Maintain UI/UX artifacts in `docs/uiux/` so front-end engineers have clear implementation guidance.

## File: docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md
`````markdown
 1: # Commit & Command Playbook
 2: 
 3: Use this checklist whenever an agent is about to commit code, run automated tooling, or apply migrations. The goal is to make every change auditable, reproducible, and aligned with the human’s expectations.
 4: 
 5: ## Before you commit
 6: 
 7: 1. **Sync memory** – Review the active file in `ai/memory/` to confirm open tasks and risk notes.
 8: 2. **Stage consciously** – Stage only files that belong to the current change request or bug fix. Leave planning artifacts (`ai/logs/**`, `ai/reports/**`) uncommitted unless the workflow explicitly asks for them.
 9: 3. **Verify tests/linters** – Run only the commands required to validate the slice. Document which commands ran, their exit codes, and any artifacts produced.
10: 4. **Summarise in the log** – Update the current change request or memory entry with a short recap of what changed, tests executed, and known gaps.
11: 
12: ## Commit message rules
13: 
14: - **Format** – `type(scope): short imperative summary`
15:   - `type`: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, or `hotfix`
16:   - `scope`: folder or capability (e.g., `backend`, `ui`, `qa`)
17:   - Example: `fix(backend): handle missing customer billing id`
18: - **Body expectations**
19:   - Reference the change request, idea, or defect id that drove the work.
20:   - List user-facing effects or API changes.
21:   - Mention tests or scripts executed (e.g., `npm test -- ...`).
22:   - Capture follow-up tasks if the fix is partial.
23: - **One logical change per commit.** If the scope expands, split the work into separate commits or request human approval to squash.
24: 
25: ## Command execution protocol
26: 
27: 1. **Declare intent** – State the command, why it is needed, and expected outputs before running anything that mutates state (installs, migrations, formatters).
28: 2. **Use explicit working directories** – Planning commands run from `./autoforge`; code/test commands run in the directories defined in `autoforge.config.json` (mirrored to `ai/code_targets.yaml`).
29: 3. **Capture results** – Summarise command output in the log; save large logs under `ai/logs/**` rather than pasting into chat.
30: 4. **Rollback plan** – If the command fails or produces unexpected artifacts, describe how to undo the change or request human guidance.
31: 
32: ## Versioning diligence
33: 
34: Before the first commit in a change sequence:
35: 
36: 1. Inspect `package.json` (or the relevant manifest) and determine whether the work warrants a **major**, **minor**, or **patch** bump:
37:    - **major** – breaking API change, incompatible configuration, or migration that requires manual action.
38:    - **minor** – backwards-compatible feature, new endpoint, or UX addition.
39:    - **patch** – bug fix, dependency upgrade with no feature change, copy tweak.
40: 2. Update the version number following semantic versioning and stage the manifest alongside any generated lockfiles.
41: 3. Record the reasoning for the bump in the commit body (e.g., “Minor bump to 1.4.0 for dashboard filter feature”).
42: 4. If no bump is required (documentation-only change), explicitly state that rationale in the memory file and commit message.
43: 
44: ## Bug fixes vs. change requests
45: 
46: - **Change requests** – Follow `change_requests/README.md` and link commits to the request id (`CR-####`). Use the main kickoff or role-specific prompts.
47: - **Hotfix / bug fix** – For urgent defects, run `ai/prompts/hotfix.yaml`. It keeps scope tight, requires repro steps, and hands off to `fullstack_engineer`.
48:   - Commits from hotfixes should use the `hotfix` or `fix` type and include incident metadata in the body.
49:   - After the fix, update the memory file and schedule a retrospective run if the incident warrants one.
50: 
51: ## Human approvals
52: 
53: - Pause if a command needs elevated privileges, impacts environments beyond local development, or modifies files outside declared targets.
54: - Always summarise the planned commit before executing `git commit` so the human can veto or request edits.
55: - If multiple agents collaborate on the same slice, the Mastermind or coordinator is responsible for ensuring commit history stays clean and matches the documented plan.
56: 
57: By following this playbook, assistants remain transparent, predictable teammates and make handoffs between humans and AI frictionless.

## File: docs/blueprint/AGENTIC_BLUEPRINT.md
`````markdown
 1: # Agentic Blueprint
 2: 
 3: ## Vision
 4: 
 5: Describe the end-to-end experience the ROS AI platform will deliver. Clarify the primary personas (investor, analyst, partner, admin) and the business outcomes we target.
 6: 
 7: ## Product Pillars
 8: 
 9: 1. **Discovery & Research** – Surface high-quality opportunities and contextual insights.
10: 2. **Due Diligence Automation** – Automate underwriting, document checks, and compliance workflows.
11: 3. **Execution Orchestration** – Coordinate stakeholders through the 14-stage assembly line.
12: 4. **Reporting & Analytics** – Provide live dashboards, alerts, and actionable intelligence.
13: 
14: ## Architecture Overview
15: 
16: - **Frontend**: Web client (React/Vite) consuming GraphQL/REST APIs, leveraging component primitives documented in `/src`.
17: - **Backend**: Service layer (Node/Express or Wasp) that implements domain logic, integrates third-party data providers, and exposes APIs defined in `api/openapi.yaml`.
18: - **Data**: PostgreSQL for transactional data, optional warehouse for analytics.
19: - **Infra/DevOps**: Containerized workloads deployed via GitHub Actions to cloud (e.g., GCP Cloud Run), with observability (logs, metrics, traces) wired through devops artifacts.
20: 
21: ## Governance
22: 
23: - Every feature flows through the agent chain defined in `ai/AGENTS.md`.
24: - Change requests originate in `change_requests/` and must pass QA, security, and DevOps gates.
25: - Documentation updates are part of the deliverable; agents cannot merge changes without updating the blueprint or PRD.
26: 
27: ## Current Status
28: 
29: Use this section to note active initiatives, open risks, or pending decisions. Update during each change request to keep the blueprint synchronized with implementation reality.

19: - API contract: `api/openapi.yaml`
20: 
21: ## Outputs / Handoff
22: 
23: The agent should:
24: 
25: 1. Reference each PRD feature and map it to UI components.
26: 2. Link UI states to relevant API endpoints.
27: 3. Provide implementation notes for front-end engineers (component structure,
28:    state management hints, etc.).
29: 4. Log summaries under `ai/reports/uiux/`.
30: 
31: ## Usage
32: 
33: When running the UI/UX Designer prompt, ensure:
34: 
35: - Working directory is set to the AutoForge folder.
36: - All generated artifacts remain within `docs/uiux/` or `ai/reports/uiux/`.
37: - Front-end engineers consult the managed `ai/code_targets.yaml` (generated from autoforge.config.json) to implement the designs in
38:   the host project’s codebase.
39: - Execute `ai/prompts/uiux_designer.yaml` (or `.autoforge/ai/prompts/uiux_designer.yaml` when embedded) to populate and maintain these files.
40: 
41: ## Prompt Snippet
42:

 3: The Mastermind Coordinator governs the ROS AI agent network. This document captures operating principles.
 4: 
 5: ## Core Responsibilities
 6: 
 7: - Sequence agent prompts according to the manifest.
 8: - Validate quality gates before approving merges or deployments.
 9: - Maintain transparency through logs and reports.
10: - Escalate unresolved conflicts or context gaps to human stakeholders.
11: 
12: ## Workflow States
13: 
14: 1. **Intake** – Receive idea or change request.
15: 2. **Analysis** – Architects and researchers determine scope and impact.
16: 3. **Implementation** – Engineers execute tasks and deliver code/tests.
17: 4. **Verification** – QA and Security evaluate outcomes.
18: 5. **Deployment** – DevOps promotes changes through environments.
19: 6. **Retrospective** – Lessons learned captured for continuous improvement.
20: 
21: ## Logging Locations
22: 
23: - Mastermind coordination: `ai/logs/mastermind/`
24: - QA runs: `ai/logs/test_runs/`
25: - Deployment history: `ai/logs/deployments/`
26: - Security findings: `security/reports/`
27:

## File: docs/MASTERMIND_PROMPTING_GUIDE.md
`````markdown
 1: # Mastermind Prompting Guide
 2: 
 3: This guide standardises how agents exchange information through prompts and handoff payloads.
 4: 
 5: ## Master Prompt Schema
 6: 
 7: ```yaml
 8: agent_role: "Architect"
 9: objective: "Design database schema for underwriting module"
10: inputs:
11:   - docs/blueprint/spec.md
12:   - api/openapi.yaml
13: constraints:
14:   - Follow security policy in security/SECURITY_READINESS.md
15:   - Must support multi-tenant data separation
16: deliverables:
17:   - diagrams/data_model.mmd
18: handoff_to: "Full-Stack Engineer"
19: ```
20: 
21: ## Handoff JSON Schema
22: 
23: ```json
24: {
25:   "task_id": "CR-2025-08",
26:   "sender": "Architect",
27:   "receiver": "Full-Stack Engineer",
28:   "artifact_path": "api/openapi.yaml",
29:   "status": "complete",
30:   "timestamp": "2025-10-21T15:12:00Z"
31: }
32: ```
33: 
34: ## Communication Rules
35: 
36: 1. **Chain of Trust** – Each agent confirms previous deliverables before proceeding.
37: 2. **Atomic Tasks** – Break large requests into atomic deliverables; no partial handoffs.
38: 3. **Error Escalation** – If ambiguity remains, request clarification instead of guessing.
39: 4. **Transparency** – Log reasoning summaries in the deliverable or accompanying log file.
40: 5. **Approval** – Humans control GO/NO-GO decisions; agents must never override them.
41: 
42: ## Logging
43: 
44: - Mastermind activity → `ai/logs/mastermind/`.
45: - QA runs → `ai/logs/test_runs/`.
46: - Deployments → `ai/logs/deployments/`.
47: - UI/UX design sessions → `ai/logs/uiux/`.
48: 
49: Keep this guide updated so every assistant (Codex, Claude, Gemini, etc.) follows the same playbook.

 50: ## 🔄 Execution Flow Overview
 51: 
 52: **Primary chain:**
 53: `Product Manager → UI/UX Designer → Architect → Engineer → QA → Security → Performance → SRE → DevOps → Retrospective`
 54: 
 55: Each prompt defines:
 56: 
 57: - Inputs and outputs
 58: - Quality gates
 59: - Handoff file
 60: - Fallback behavior
 61: 
 62: GitHub workflows monitor these triggers to maintain the loop automatically.
 63: 
 64: ---
 65: 
 66: ## 🧩 Key Implementation Additions
 67: 
 68: ### 1. Unified UI/UX Framework
 69: 
 70: Added `docs/uiux/` containing:
 71: 
 72: - `wireframes.md`
 73: - `user_flows.md`
 74: - `style_guide.md`
 75: - `accessibility_guidelines.md`
 76: 
 77: These provide the visual and experiential foundation for all front-end generation tasks.
 78: 
 79: ### 2. Expanded `autoforge.config.json` (codeTargets)
 80: 
 81: Defines explicit directories for backend, frontend, and tests to ensure deterministic agent output. Regenerate the managed YAML with `npx autoforge configure` after editing.
 82: 
 83: ```json
 84: {
 85:   "codeTargets": {
 86:     "backend": { "path": "../src/backend" },
 87:     "frontend": { "path": "../src/frontend" },
 88:     "tests": { "path": "../tests" }
 89:   }
 90: }
 91: ```
 92: 
 93: ### 3. Folder-Level Prompt Guides
 94: 
 95: Every major folder (ideas, research, docs, qa, devops, ai) now includes a `README.md` or `.prompt.md` describing purpose and next steps.
 96: → Converts AutoForge into a **self-documenting prompt ecosystem.**
 97: 
 98: ### 4. Example Lifecycle
 99: 
100: `examples/fullstack_todo_app/` demonstrates the entire AI-driven workflow—from idea intake to retrospective report—providing training data for new users and agents.
101: 
102: ### 5. Validation Script
103: 
104: `scripts/validate_context.js` enforces the quality gates in `ai/context.manifest.yaml` before execution or PR merge.
105:

133: 
134: ✅ **All checks passed** — no critical dependencies missing.
135: 
136: ---
137: 
138: ## 🧭 Final Production-Ready Recommendations
139: 
140: 1. **Lock Version 1.0.0 tag** in GitHub once merge tests pass.
141: 2. **Add a root-level README** with a clear “Getting Started” section and Kickoff command snippet:
142: 
143:    ```
144:    npm install --save-dev @cojacklabs/autoforge
145:    npx autoforge init
146:    npx autoforge validate
147:    ```
148: 
149: 3. **Publish a quick-start guide** (`/docs/QUICKSTART.md`) for external devs.
150: 4. **Enable Discussions tab** on GitHub for user feedback.
151: 5. **Announce public release** via CoJack Labs and Juntos Group channels.
152: 
153: ---
154: 
155: ## 🧠 Overall Verdict

 5: summary: |
 6:   Build a collaborative todo list app for small teams with task assignments, due dates, and completion tracking.
 7: goals:
 8:   - Improve task visibility for small teams
 9:   - Provide lightweight collaboration compared to heavy project management suites
10: constraints:
11:   - Mobile friendly (responsive design)
12:   - Support up to 50 concurrent users (MVP)
13:   - Authentication via email/password
14: success_metrics:
15:   - 70% of beta users complete onboarding within 5 minutes
16:   - Daily active users > 30 within first month
17: assumptions:
18:   - Teams use email for coordination
19:   - Users want simple kanban-like workflow
20: notes: |
21:   Seed data and mocks acceptable for MVP; integrate real email later.

## File: examples/fullstack_todo_app/research/briefs/brief_todo_app.md
`````markdown
 1: # Feasibility Brief – Team Todo App
 2: 
 3: ## Summary
 4: 
 5: - Market gap for small-team collaboration tools that are simpler than full PM suites.
 6: - Users prioritized quick task entry, assignments, due dates, and basic progress tracking.
 7: - MVP should focus on responsive web experience with email/password auth.
 8: 
 9: ## Key Findings
10: 
11: - Competitors (Trello/Asana) perceived as heavy for small teams; opportunity to differentiate on simplicity.
12: - Interviewees emphasized: due dates, reminders, ability to assign tasks to teammates.
13: - Real-time updates nice-to-have; can defer to Phase 2 (websocket support).
14: 
15: ## Risks
16: 
17: - Notification overload; start with simple daily digest.
18: - Data privacy considerations even for small teams (must use secure storage and HTTPS).
19: 
20: ## Recommendations
21: 
22: - Build React frontend with simple kanban board.
23: - Node/Express backend with REST API; Postgres for persistence.
24: - MVP feature set: tasks CRUD, assignments, due dates, notes, simple status.
25: 
26: ## Next Steps
27: 
28: - Update PRD with prioritized features and user stories.
29: - Proceed to blueprint and UI/UX design stages.

 2: 
 3: ## Objectives
 4: 
 5: - Validate market demand for a lightweight team todo application.
 6: - Identify existing competitors and differentiation opportunities.
 7: - Determine the critical feature set for MVP (task management, assignments, due dates).
 8: - Assess technical feasibility with current stack (React/Node/Postgres).
 9: 
10: ## Methodology
11: 
12: - Competitive analysis (Trello, Asana, Todoist team plans).
13: - User interviews with 5 small teams (≤ 10 members).
14: - Technical feasibility review for real-time updates and notification requirements.
15: 
16: ## Data Sources
17: 
18: - Public reviews of competitor products.
19: - Internal interviews with in-house teams.
20: - Tech stack documentation (React, Express, PostgreSQL).
21: 
22: ## Deliverables
23: 
24: - Feasibility brief summarizing findings (stored in `../briefs/`).
25: - Updated PRD sections reflecting user needs and constraints.
26: 
27: ## Next Steps
28: 
29: - Run the research due diligence prompt to produce the corresponding brief.

 1: # Idea Stage
 2: 
 3: Capture raw product ideas and initial prompts here.
 4: 
 5: - Use `IDEA_TEMPLATE.yaml` to define the problem, goals, and success metrics.
 6: - Once an idea is documented, run the idea intake prompt to create a research plan.
 7: - Store follow-up outputs in `../research/plans/` and `../research/briefs/`.
 8: 
 9: This folder anchors the starting point (Brainstorm) of the AutoForge SDLC pipeline.

14: - `autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_intake.yaml`
15: 
16: ## Collaboration tips
17: 
18: - Discuss ideas with the assistant from inside `./autoforge` so interviews, notes, and drafts land in `ideas/` and `ai/logs/research/`.
19: - If the agent misinterprets the vision, update the idea file directly or provide inline corrections—subsequent prompts will treat the edited YAML as canonical.
20: - Before handing off to architecture or engineering, skim the captured logs to make sure the story reflects what you want built; adjust here before the downstream prompts begin.
21: - Summarize the final direction in the active memory file (`ai/memory/*.yaml`) so later sessions or different tools inherit the same context.

`````markdown
 1: # Code of Conduct
 2: 
 3: We follow the Contributor Covenant to foster an open and welcoming community.
 4: 
 5: ## Our Pledge
 6: 
 7: We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
 8: community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
 9: size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
10: identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
11: nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity
12: and orientation.
13: 
14: ## Our Standards
15: 
16: Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
17: 
18: - Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
19: - Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
20: - Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
21: - Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and
22:   learning from the experience
23: - Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
24:   community
25: 
26: Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
27: 
28: - The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
29:   any kind
30: - Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
31: - Public or private harassment
32: - Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
33:   without their explicit permission
34: - Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
35:   professional setting
36: 
37: ## Enforcement Responsibilities
38: 
39: Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
40: acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
41: response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or
42: harmful.
43: 
44: ## Scope
45: 
46: This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when
47: an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public
48: spaces.
49: 
50: ## Enforcement
51: 
52: Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported
53: to the maintainers at support@cojacklabs.com. All complaints will be reviewed and
54: investigated promptly and fairly.
55: 
56: All maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter
57: of any incident.
58: 
59: ## Attribution
60: 
61: This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org),
62: version 2.1.

 1: # Contributing to @cojacklabs/autoforge
 2: 
 3: Thanks for your interest in contributing! AutoForge is an embedded, multi‑agent SDLC framework. This guide helps you get set up, make changes confidently, and submit high‑quality pull requests.
 4: 
 5: ## Quick start
 6: 
 7: - Fork the repo to your GitHub account
 8: - Clone your fork locally and add the upstream remote
 9: - Create a feature branch for your change
10: 
11: ```bash
12: git clone https://github.com/<you>/autoforge.git
13: cd autoforge
14: git remote add upstream https://github.com/cojacklabs/autoforge.git
15: git checkout -b feat/<short-topic>
16: ```
17: 
18: ## Dev setup
19: 
20: - Node.js 18+ recommended
21: - Install dev dependencies (already vendored in package.json)
22: 
23: ```bash
24: npm install
25: npm run build
26: ```
27: 
28: AutoForge is designed to live inside another project under `./autoforge`. During development, most changes are documentation, prompts, or CLI code in this repo.
29: 
30: ## Working philosophy
31: 
32: - Managed files: `ai/code_targets.yaml` and `ai/context_targets.yaml` are generated from `autoforge.config.json`. Do not hand‑edit them; instead:
33:   - Edit `autoforge.config.json`
34:   - Run `npx autoforge configure`
35: - Planning‑first: Quality gates accept canonical docs under `docs/`, `api/`, `diagrams/` or planning stubs under `.autoforge/ai/reports/**`.
36: - Shared progress: Keep `ai/AGENTS.md` updated (Progress & Next Steps, Lessons Learned, Rules) so work transfers across IDEs/CLIs.
37: 
38: ## Local checks
39: 
40: Before opening a PR, please run:
41: 
42: ```bash
43: npm run build              # refresh dist/
44: npx autoforge configure    # regenerate managed YAML from config (if changed)
45: npx autoforge validate     # run quality gates
46: npm run format:check       # ensure code style
47: ```
48: 
49: Optional:
50: 
51: ```bash
52: npx autoforge load         # generate the copy/paste context prompt for your AI
53: npx autoforge snapshot     # write REPO.md (context snapshot) if relevant
54: ```
55: 
56: ## Commit guidelines
57: 
58: - Follow the conventional style and our playbook: see `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md`
59: - Scope examples: `feat(cli): add load subcommand`, `docs: clarify quality gates`
60: - Keep commits focused; include rationale and any semantic versioning implications
61: 
62: ## Pull request checklist
63: 
64: - [ ] Change is scoped and focused
65: - [ ] Docs updated (README, prompts, guides) when behavior changes
66: - [ ] `npm run build` passes; dist contains expected updates
67: - [ ] `npx autoforge validate` passes (if applicable)
68: - [ ] Linked to any related issue(s) or discussion
69: 
70: ## Finding issues
71: 
72: - Look for issues labeled `good first issue` (great for onboarding) and `help wanted`
73: - If you’re unsure where to start, open a Discussion or comment on an issue to coordinate
74: 
75: ## Code of Conduct
76: 
77: Participation in this project is governed by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read it to understand expected behavior.
78: 
79: ## License
80: 
81: By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the repository’s [MIT License](LICENSE).

## File: docs/ai/AGENT_AUTONOMY_GUIDE.md
`````markdown
 1: # Agent Autonomy Guide
 2: 
 3: This guide explains how the ROS AI agent network navigates and operates inside the repository.
 4: 
 5: ## Two-World Model
 6: 
 7: - **Human Realm** – Source-of-truth docs live under `docs/`, operational configs under `devops/`, security policies under `security/`, and product artifacts under `api/`, `diagrams/`, and `qa/`. When AutoForge is embedded in another project, these folders reside under `./.autoforge/` (legacy: `./autoforge/`).
 8: - **AI Realm** – Manifests, prompts, and logs live under `ai/`. Agents never guess where context lives; they read `ai/context.manifest.yaml` for the canonical map.
 9: 
10: > Application code/output paths are defined in `autoforge.config.json` and mirrored to the managed `ai/code_targets.yaml`. Ask the human to update the config and rerun `npx autoforge configure` before running engineering prompts.
11: > The same applies to documentation overrides: `ai/context_targets.yaml` is managed—coordinate any changes through `autoforge.config.json` + `npx autoforge configure`.
12: 
13: ## Entry Sequence
14: 
15: 1. Begin in the planning zone: set `cwd` to the folder that contains this guide (for embedded installs that is `./.autoforge`).
16: 2. Read `ai/context.manifest.yaml` to discover context roots and quality gates.
17: 3. Review `ai/memory/ACTIVE_MEMORY.yaml` to absorb the latest decisions, corrections, and outstanding tasks. Always append new updates before ending a session.
18: 4. Consult and maintain `ai/AGENTS.md` (Progress & Next Steps, Lessons Learned, and Rules). Update it at each major handoff so humans and future tools have the same context.
19: 5. Load entrypoint files (`docs/blueprint/AGENTIC_BLUEPRINT.md`, `api/openapi.yaml`, etc.).
20: 6. Expand using `include_globs` while honouring `exclusions`.
21: 7. Validate quality gates via `scripts/validate_context.sh` when available.
22: 8. Switch to a build zone only when writing code/tests: consult the managed `ai/code_targets.yaml` (generated from `autoforge.config.json`), operate inside each declared `code_targets.*.path`, then return to the planning zone to update docs and logs.
23: 9. Record outputs to `ai/logs/` or the designated deliverable path and log every movement between planning and build zones in the activity notes. Update the memory file (`ai/memory/ACTIVE_MEMORY.yaml`) with new outcomes before handing off or ending the session; sync changes back to `ai/AGENTS.md` if the high-level progress shifts.
24: 
25: ### Approval cadence
26: 
27: - Mention any package install, migration, or long-running command before you execute it, including which directories it will modify.
28: - If you must touch a path that is not listed in the managed code targets or under the planning zone, pause and request human approval.
29: - Keep debugging commands scoped (e.g., `npm test -- some-pattern`), describe expected side effects, and revert back to the planning zone after they finish.
30: - Consult `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md` before staging commits or running stateful commands so outputs stay auditable.
31: 
32: ## Handoffs
33: 
34: - Agents communicate through structured prompts defined in `ai/prompts/`.
35: - Every handoff includes a JSON snippet (see `docs/MASTERMIND_PROMPTING_GUIDE.md`) capturing sender, receiver, artifact path, and status.
36: - If context is missing or invalid, agents do **not** forge ahead—they raise a context gap and notify the Mastermind Coordinator.
37: - UI/UX artifacts should be stored under `docs/uiux/` and summarized in `ai/reports/uiux/`.
38: 
39: ## Human Responsibilities
40: 
41: - Keep documentation up to date; the agents rely entirely on the files referenced in the manifest.
42: - Approve GO/NO-GO decisions, especially for production deployments or security findings.
43: - Review retrospectives in `ai/reports/` and schedule follow-up actions.
44: - Keep the active memory file in `ai/memory/` current so future sessions inherit the latest state.
45: - Enforce the commit/command rules documented in `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md` during reviews.
46: - Verify semantic version changes are applied (or explicitly waived) per the playbook before approving merges.
47: - Run `npm update @cojacklabs/autoforge || npx autoforge upgrade` periodically to pull upstream framework changes and rerun guardrails (local AutoForge edits are auto-stashed and restored).
48: - After updating, append a memory entry summarising new guidance and require agents to reload the manifests before resuming work.
49: - Ensure `contextTargets` in `autoforge.config.json` stays accurate and rerun `npx autoforge configure` so documentation references stay aligned.
50: - Maintain code target settings in `autoforge.config.json` (then rerun `npx autoforge configure`) so engineering agents place code and tests in the correct host-project locations.
51: - Use `ai/logs/uiux/` and `ai/reports/uiux/` to audit UI/UX decisions before engineering begins.
52: 
53: By maintaining clear boundaries and accurate context, we allow autonomous agents to handle the heavy lifting while humans steer vision and approval.
54: 
55: ## Context Snapshots
56: 
57: - Use `npx autoforge snapshot [path]` (run from the repo root, or from `./.autoforge` and pass `..`) to produce `REPO.md` when sharing context with LLMs. Prefer the `context_snapshot` prompt when humans request help refreshing repository knowledge.
58: 
59: - Update `repomix.config.json` if you need to include/exclude additional folders when generating snapshots.

## File: docs/PROMPT_HANDBOOK.md
`````markdown
 1: # Prompt Handbook
 2: 
 3: Use these patterns when working with coding assistants (Codex, Claude Code, Gemini Code, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, etc.). Replace placeholders with your context.
 4: 
 5: ## 1. Describe the environment
 6: 
 7: ```
 8: The AutoForge folder is located at ./autoforge. Treat that directory as your working root.
 9: Code should be written to the paths defined in autoforge.config.json (mirrored to .autoforge/ai/code_targets.yaml). Legacy installs may use `autoforge/`; the CLI supports both.
10: ```
11: 
12: ## 2. Load mandatory context
13: 
14: ```
15: Read the following files:
16: - .autoforge/ai/context.manifest.yaml
17: - .autoforge/ai/agents.yaml
18: - .autoforge/ai/prompts/<agent>.yaml (as needed)
19: - For kickoff: .autoforge/ai/prompts/kickoff.yaml
20: ```
21: 
22: ## 3. Explore the vision (high reasoning)
23: 
24: ```
25: Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_conversation.yaml
26: Partner with me on the product vision. Ask layered questions about user goals,
27: platform (web/mobile/desktop/framework), data, integrations, and delivery cadence.
28: Summarise decisions under ideas/ and ai/logs/ideas/.
29: ```
30: 
31: ## 4. Capture the vision (idea stage template)
32: 
33: ```
34: Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/discovery_researcher.yaml
35: Help me capture the project idea by asking targeted questions.
36: ```
37: 
38: ## 5. Create structured plans
39: 
40: ```
41: Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_intake.yaml
42: Using ideas/IDEA-2025...yaml and the discovery note, produce the idea intake plan.
43: ```
44: 
45: ## 6. Share repository context
46: 
47: ```
48: Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/context_snapshot.yaml
49: Run `npx autoforge snapshot` to regenerate REPO.md and brief me on the layout,
50: tech stack, and hotspots the next agents should prioritise.
51: ```
52: 
53: ## 7. Kickoff / Change flow
54: 
55: Refer to kickoff snippet in README or Quickstart. After kickoff, target prompts role-by-role (`Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/architect.yaml`, etc.).
56: 
57: ## 8. Record decisions
58: 
59: ``` 
60: Write a summary of this discussion to .autoforge/ai/logs/research/...
61: Update ai/AGENTS.md (Progress & Next Steps, Lessons Learned) with the current status so any IDE/CLI can resume.
62: A: Save the session by appending the key updates to ai/memory/ACTIVE_MEMORY.yaml (follow the template). Confirm the file was written before ending the session.
63: ```
64: 
65: ## 9. Give go/no-go
66: 
67: ```
68: The idea is approved. Please begin the full kickoff sequence.
69: ```
`````

## File: docs/QUICKSTART.md
`````markdown
  1: # AutoForge Quickstart (Embedded Mode)
  2: 
  3: Follow these steps to run AutoForge inside an existing project using Chat Mode.
  4: 
  5: Tip: For a broader, multi‑project overview (roles, approvals, automation features, and recipes), see `docs/AUTOFORGE_MULTI_PROJECT_GUIDE.md`.
  6: 
  7: ## 1. Install & Initialize
  8: 
  9: ```bash
 10: npm install --save-dev @cojacklabs/autoforge
 11: npx autoforge init
 12: npx autoforge load   # emits a copy/paste prompt to train your AI on context + memory
 13: ```
 14: 
 15: This scaffolds `.autoforge/` in your repo and writes `autoforge.config.json`; runtime dependencies arrive with the npm package and the default configuration is applied so everything is ready for your coding assistant.
 16: 
 17: ## 2. Configure Paths
 18: 
 19: - Update `codeTargets` inside `autoforge.config.json` so backend/frontend/tests (and any extras) point at your project.
 20: - (Optional) adjust `contextTargets` if PRD/blueprint/UI/UX docs live outside the defaults.
 21: - After editing, run `npx autoforge configure` to regenerate the managed `ai/code_targets.yaml` and `ai/context_targets.yaml` files. Avoid hand-editing files under `./.autoforge` unless directed by the framework.
 22: 
 23: ## 3. Capture the Idea
 24: 
 25: Start with a high-reasoning conversation when you want the agent to brainstorm options:
 26: 
 27: ```
 28: Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_conversation.yaml
 29: Let's explore the product vision, platforms, tech stack choices, integrations, and risks.
 30: ```
 31: 
 32: When you have the basics, either fill `ideas/IDEA_TEMPLATE.yaml` manually **or** run:
 33: 
 34: ```
 35: Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/discovery_researcher.yaml
 36: Help me capture the vision for this project.
 37: ```
 38: 
 39: Follow up with:
 40: 
 41: ```
 42: Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_intake.yaml
 43: Translate our notes into the structured idea plan for downstream agents.
 44: ```
 45: 
 46: The agents write drafts under `ideas/` plus summaries under `ai/logs/`.
 47: 
 48: ### Seed shared memory
 49: 
 50: - Copy `ai/memory/MEMORY_TEMPLATE.yaml` to `ai/memory/ACTIVE_MEMORY.yaml` (or another descriptive name).
 51: - Capture the latest decisions, corrections, and open questions after each working session.
 52: - When you start a new Chat Mode run—or swap to a different coding agent—tell it to review the active memory file before continuing the work.
 53: 
 54: ## 4. Validate Quality Gates
 55: 
 56: ```bash
 57: npx autoforge validate
 58: ```
 59: 
 60: Quality gates accept either canonical docs under `docs/`, `api/`, `diagrams/` or planning copies under `./.autoforge/ai/reports/**` (e.g., `.autoforge/ai/reports/prd_stub.md`, `.autoforge/ai/reports/openapi_stub.yaml`, `.autoforge/ai/reports/diagrams/*.mmd`).
 61: You can override validation patterns via `contextTargets.requiredGlobs` in `autoforge.config.json`.
 62: 
 63: ## 5. Kick Off (Chat Mode)
 64: 
 65: Paste the block below into your coding assistant:
 66: 
 67: ```
 68: Read and follow:
 69: - .autoforge/ai/context.manifest.yaml
 70: - .autoforge/ai/agents.yaml
 71: - .autoforge/ai/prompts/kickoff.yaml
 72: 
 73: While planning, stay inside ./.autoforge for docs/logs.
 74: When writing code/tests, use the paths defined in autoforge.config.json (mirrored to .autoforge/ai/code_targets.yaml).
 75: Confirm the latest idea in ideas/.
 76: Run the kickoff sequence (PM → UI/UX → Architect → Engineer → QA → Security → Performance → SRE → DevOps → Retrospective).
 77: Log outputs to .autoforge/ai/logs/** and .autoforge/ai/reports/**.
 78: ```
 79: 
 80: ## 6. Change Requests
 81: 
 82: When you have a new feature, bug, migration, or knowledge share, run:
 83: 
 84: ```
 85: Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/change_intake.yaml
 86: Work with me to capture the request, fill in acceptance criteria, and create the change request file.
 87: ```
 88: 
 89: The agent interviews you, clones `CR-0000_example.yaml`, and saves the populated request under `change_requests/`. Review/edit the generated file, commit, and follow the Chat Mode instructions posted by the GitHub Action.
 90: 
 91: > Guidance for humans & agents
 92: >
 93: > - Capturing ideas, refining change requests, and logging updates all happen inside `./.autoforge`.
 94: > - Keep the shared memory file in `ai/memory/` up to date; new agents should review it before acting.
 95: > - Engineering prompts step out only through the code targets defined in `autoforge.config.json` (mirrored to `ai/code_targets.yaml`). Update the config and run `npx autoforge configure` before coding.
 96: > - Agents should announce package installs, migrations, or debugging commands in advance so you can approve or redirect them.
 97: > - Follow `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md` when staging commits or running impactful commands.
 98: > - Confirm semantic version bumps in package manifests before the final commit; document the rationale in the commit body.
 99: 
100: For single-issue bug fixes that cannot wait for the full change-request workflow, run `Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/hotfix.yaml` and follow the same memory/commit rules.
101: 
102: ## 7. Prompt Jumpstarts
103: 
104: - **Idea workshop** — `Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_conversation.yaml`
105: - **Share repo context** — `Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/context_snapshot.yaml`
106: - **Normalise change requests** — `Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/change_intake.yaml`
107: - **Route any request into automation** — `Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/automation_bootstrap.yaml`
108: 
109: - **Preview the plan without writing files (dry run)**
110:   ```
111:   npx autoforge dryrun web_app   # or analytics_app/mobile_app
112:   ```
113: 
114: Each prompt includes detailed instructions for the agent and where to record outputs.
115: 
116: ## 8. Snapshot the Project (Optional)
117: 
118: To create `REPO.md` for the host project:
119: 
120: ```bash
121: npx autoforge snapshot
122: ```
123: 
124: Run the command from the repo root to capture the current project, or append a path (for example, `npx autoforge snapshot ..`) to target another directory. The snapshot is a flattened context summary so AI tools can ingest the whole repository.
125: 
126: ## 9. Update AutoForge
127: 
128: When new framework updates land upstream, run:
129: 
130: ```bash
131: npx autoforge upgrade
132: ```
133: 
134: The CLI auto-stashes your `.autoforge/` edits, applies the latest framework, and restores data directories (logs, memory, change requests). Resolve conflicts if Git raises any, rerun `npx autoforge validate`, log the upgrade in memory, and ask your coding assistant to reload the manifests/playbook.

  1: # 🧠 AutoForge — Embedded Multi-Agent SDLC
  2: 
  3: [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/autoforge?color=0f9d58&label=autoforge)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cojacklabs/autoforge)
  4: 
  5: AutoForge lives as `.autoforge/` inside your existing project so coding assistants can plan, design, and ship software autonomously. Planning artifacts stay inside `.autoforge/`, while application code and tests write to your project paths. (Legacy installs used `autoforge/`; the CLI recognises both.)
  6: 
  7: > 📘 Short on time? See [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md). Need prompt examples? See [docs/PROMPT_HANDBOOK.md](docs/PROMPT_HANDBOOK.md). For multi‑project best practices and automation features, read [docs/AUTOFORGE_MULTI_PROJECT_GUIDE.md](docs/AUTOFORGE_MULTI_PROJECT_GUIDE.md).
  8: 
  9: ---
 10: 
 11: ## 1. Install AutoForge via npm
 12: 
 13: ```bash
 14: npm install --save-dev @cojacklabs/autoforge
 15: ```
 16: 
 17: ---
 18: 
 19: ## 2. Initialize the framework
 20: 
 21: ```bash
 22: npx autoforge init
 23: ```
 24: 
 25: This copies the framework into `.autoforge/`, generates `autoforge.config.json`, and keeps the structure your agents expect. Runtime dependencies are already installed alongside the npm package, and the default configuration is applied automatically—rerun `npx autoforge configure` whenever you change the config.
 26: 
 27: ### Load context for your AI (first run)
 28: 
 29: ```bash
 30: npx autoforge load
 31: ```
 32: 
 33: This emits a copy/paste prompt (also saved under `.autoforge/ai/logs/mastermind/`) to help your coding AI reload the rules, roles, progress log (`ai/AGENTS.md`), and the most recent memory file if present.
 34: 
 35: ---
 36: 
 37: ## 3. Configure once via autoforge.config.json
 38: 
 39: - Update `"codeTargets"` so backend/frontend/tests (and any extras) point to real directories in your project. After editing, run `npx autoforge configure` to regenerate the managed YAML files.
 40: - (Optional) Adjust `"contextTargets"` if your documentation (PRD/blueprint/UI/UX) lives outside the defaults.
 41: - (Optional) Override validation globs by setting `contextTargets.requiredGlobs` (e.g., custom test or CI file patterns). The validator merges your overrides with sensible defaults; set a pattern to `""` or `null` to disable a gate.
 42: - Tweak feature flags or other overrides in `autoforge.config.json` as needed. Avoid editing files inside `.autoforge/` directly—those folders are managed by the framework.
 43: 
 44: You’ve now told the agents where planning docs live and where to generate code.
 45: 
 46: ---
 47: 
 48: ## 4. Capture the idea (human ↔️ AI conversation)
 49: 
 50: AutoForge expects at least one idea file before kickoff.
 51: 
 52: - Start a high-reasoning conversation:
 53:   ```
 54:   Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_conversation.yaml
 55:   Help me explore the application vision, platforms, tech stack options, and risks.
 56:   ```
 57:   The agent will interview you, propose stacks/integrations, and log the dialogue under `ai/logs/ideas/`.
 58: - Copy `ideas/IDEA_TEMPLATE.yaml`, fill in the project vision, and save (e.g., `ideas/IDEA-0001_alpha.yaml`). **OR**
 59: - Let the assistant interview you with a tight template:
 60:   ```
 61:   Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/discovery_researcher.yaml
 62:   Help me capture the project idea by asking clarifying questions.
 63:   ```
 64:   The agent writes the filled template plus notes under `ai/logs/research/`.
 65: 
 66: Continue iterating with the assistant until the idea reflects what you want built.
 67: When you have clarity, run `Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_intake.yaml` to convert the notes into a structured plan for the Assembly Line.
 68: Record the most important decisions or clarifications in `ai/memory/` so future sessions inherit the same story.
 69: 
 70: ---
 71: 
 72: ## 5. Validate quality gates
 73: 
 74: ```bash
 75: npx autoforge validate
 76: ```
 77: 
 78: This enforces everything in `ai/context.manifest.yaml` (PRD present, diagrams exist, security checklist ready, observability docs, etc.). Quality gates now accept either the canonical docs under `docs/`, `api/`, `diagrams/` or planning-first copies under `./.autoforge/ai/reports/**` (e.g., `.autoforge/ai/reports/openapi_stub.yaml`, `.autoforge/ai/reports/diagrams/*.mmd`). If something is missing, add the canonical file or a planning stub before moving on.
 79: 
 80: ---
 81: 
 82: ### Workspace boundaries & approvals
 83: 
 84: - Planning/logging: keep your assistant in `./.autoforge` so ideas, research, and reports stay contained. (Legacy: `./autoforge`)
 85: - Implementation: agents may only touch the host project through the code targets defined in `autoforge.config.json` (mirrored to the managed `ai/code_targets.yaml`). Update the config and rerun `npx autoforge configure` before coding.
 86: - Elevated actions (package installs, long-running scripts, migrations) should be called out explicitly so the human reviewer can approve before execution.
 87: 
 88: ---
 89: 
 90: ### Guiding your AI teammate
 91: 
 92: - Kick off every session by pointing the agent at the latest `ideas/IDEA_*.yaml` entry and clarifying the goal in your own words.
 93: - If the agent drifts or makes wrong assumptions, edit the relevant docs (idea, PRD, tech blueprint) or reply with corrections—AutoForge treats those files as the single source of truth.
 94: - Remind the agent to log discoveries under `ai/logs/**` and summaries under `ai/reports/**` so you can audit each step.
 95: - Use change requests when the scope shifts; the prompts walk the agent through impact analysis and give you checkpoints to accept or redirect work.
 96: - Expect the agent to ask before running package installs, migrations, or touching files outside the declared targets—approve or deny explicitly to keep control of your repo.
 97: - Keep an active memory file under `ai/memory/` up to date after each session; direct new assistants to review it before continuing work.
 98: - Before staging commits or running stateful commands, have the agent review `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md` so history stays clean and reproducible.
 99: - Confirm semantic version bumps (package.json, etc.) follow the playbook—major for breaking changes, minor for new features, patch for fixes.
100: 
101: ---
102: 
103: ## 6. Kick off with your coding AI
104: 
105: The kickoff prompt now confirms there is a current idea file before orchestrating
106: the Assembly Line. If none exists, it will instruct you to run `idea_conversation`
107: or drop a Markdown brief into `ideas/` so the agents can work autonomously.
108: 
109: Paste the snippet below into your coding assistant (Codex, Claude Code, Gemini Code, Cursor, etc.). This sets the stage for multi-agent handoffs.
110: 
111: ```
112: Read and follow:
113: - .autoforge/ai/context.manifest.yaml
114: - .autoforge/ai/agents.yaml
115: - .autoforge/ai/prompts/kickoff.yaml
116: 
117: While planning: stay inside ./autoforge for docs/logs.
118: When writing code/tests: use the paths defined in autoforge.config.json (mirrored to .autoforge/ai/code_targets.yaml).
119: Confirm the latest idea in ideas/.
120: Run the kickoff sequence (Product Manager → UI/UX → Architect → Engineer → QA → Security → Performance → SRE → DevOps → Retrospective).
121: Log outputs to .autoforge/ai/logs/** and .autoforge/ai/reports/**.
122: ```
123: 
124: ### Follow-up prompts
125: 
126: After kickoff completes you can continue agent-by-agent:
127: 
128: - `Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/architect.yaml`
129: - `Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/fullstack_engineer.yaml`
130: - … and so on down the chain.
131: 
132: Refer to [docs/prompt_handbook.md](docs/prompt_handbook.md) for ready-made snippet patterns.
133: 
134: ---
135: 
136: ## 7. Prompt jumpstarts (copy/paste ready)
137: 
138: - **Idea workshop (AI agent interview)**
139:   ```
140:   Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/idea_conversation.yaml
141:   Partner with me on the product vision. Ask layered questions about audience,
142:   platform (web/mobile/desktop/framework), tech stack options, third-party integrations,
143:   delivery cadence, and risks. Summarize decisions in ideas/ and ai/logs/ideas/.
144:   ```
145: - **Share the current project context**
146:   ```
147:   Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/context_snapshot.yaml
148:   Generate a fresh REPO.md snapshot of the host project with `npx autoforge snapshot`.
149:   Highlight notable directories, recent changes, and any risks downstream agents should know.
150:   ```
151: - **Intake a structured change request**
152:   ```
153:   Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/change_intake.yaml
154:   I have a change request (feature/bug/migration/knowledge share).
155:   Interview me, capture acceptance criteria, and create the change_requests/ record and intake log.
156:   ```
157: - **Route any engagement into the SDLC Assembly Line**
158:   ```
159:   Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/automation_bootstrap.yaml
160:   Diagnose whether I need a new build, help on an existing codebase, a migration, or troubleshooting.
161:   Discover available recipes under docs/blueprint/recipes/*.yaml and propose the best fit.
162:   STOP for approval, then trigger the right prompts (kickoff, change intake, context snapshot, etc.).
163:   ```
164: 
165: - **Preview the plan without writing files (dry run)**
166:   ```
167:   npx autoforge dryrun web_app   # or analytics_app/mobile_app
168:   # Prints a step-by-step checklist from the selected recipe, preflight checks,
169:   # and approval gates — no files are written.
170:   ```
171: 
172: ---
173: 
174: ## 8. Change request workflow (human ↔️ AI loop)
175: 
176: 1. Tell the assistant what needs to change:
177:    ```
178:    Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/change_intake.yaml
179:    I need help with <feature|bug|migration|knowledge share>.
180:    Ask follow-up questions, create the change request file for me, and log any open issues.
181:    ```
182:    The agent interviews you, clones `CR-0000_example.yaml`, and saves a populated record under `change_requests/`.
183: 2. Review or edit the generated change request if needed, then commit/push. The GitHub Action validates and posts instructions in the run summary.
184: 3. In Chat Mode, run the prompts in order:
185:    - `Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/change_request.yaml`
186:    - (If UX involved) `Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/uiux_designer.yaml`
187:    - `Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/impact_analysis.yaml`
188:    - Follow the chain (Fullstack → QA → Security → Performance → SRE → DevOps → Retrospective)
189: 4. Record outputs to the paths defined in each prompt (`ai/logs/**`, `ai/reports/**`, etc.).
190: 
191: > Urgent defect? Run `Execute .autoforge/ai/prompts/hotfix.yaml` instead. It keeps the scope to a single bug, enforces reproducibility, and still requires you to follow the commit rules in `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md`.
192: 
193: ---
194: 
195: ## 9. Stage gate checklist
196: 
197: Tick these items before shipping a slice:
198: 
199: - ✔ Idea: `.autoforge/ideas/IDEA_*.yaml`
200: - ✔ UI/UX: `.autoforge/docs/uiux/style_guide.md`, `wireframes.md`, `user_flows.md`, `accessibility_guidelines.md`, `ai/reports/uiux/*.md`
201: - ✔ Architecture: `.autoforge/docs/blueprint/*.md`, `.autoforge/diagrams/*.mmd`, `.autoforge/api/openapi.yaml`
202: - ✔ Engineering outputs: code targets from `autoforge.config.json` (mirrored to `.autoforge/ai/code_targets.yaml`) contain new code (`../src/backend`, `../src/frontend`, `../tests` by default)
203: - ✔ QA: `.autoforge/ai/logs/test_runs/latest_report.md`, `.autoforge/qa/reports/defects.md`
204: - ✔ Security: `.autoforge/security/reports/security_audit.md`, `.autoforge/security/reports/findings.json`
205: - ✔ Performance: `.autoforge/docs/perf/plan.md`, `.autoforge/docs/perf/scripts/*`, `.autoforge/ai/reports/perf/*.md`
206: - ✔ Observability: `.autoforge/docs/observability/dashboards.md`, `alerts.md`, `slo.md`, `.autoforge/ai/reports/observability/*.md`
207: - ✔ DevOps: `.autoforge/devops/runbooks/deploy.md`, `.autoforge/ai/logs/deployments/*_deploy.md`
208: - ✔ Retrospective: `.autoforge/ai/reports/retrospective_*.md`
209: - ✔ Versioning: package manifests bumped per docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md and rationale captured in commits/memory.
210: 
211: Tip: Recipe-driven CI templates live under `devops/ci/` (e.g., `devops/ci/web_app.yml`). Copy and adapt them in your host repo or reference as examples.
212: 
213: ---
214: 
215: ## 10. Demo slice (optional)
216: 
217: Need a sample to test? Update `codeTargets` in `autoforge.config.json` (then run `npx autoforge configure`) to point at the demo directories and try:
218: 
219: - `examples/fullstack_todo_app/demo_src/backend/server.js`
220: - `examples/fullstack_todo_app/demo_src/frontend/index.html`
221: - `node --test examples/fullstack_todo_app/demo_src/tests/todo.test.js`
222: 
223: CI already runs this example as part of `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
224: 
225: ---
226: 
227: ## 11. Generate repository snapshot (optional)
228: 
229: From your project root (or to targeted `<path`> for safe keeping):
230: 
231: ```bash
232: npx autoforge snapshot <path>        # writes REPO.md next to the folder you target
233: ```
234: 
235: The generated `REPO.md` makes it easy to share the entire codebase with an AI model.
236: 
237: ---
238: 
239: ## 12. Update AutoForge
240: 
241: ```bash
242: npx autoforge upgrade
243: ```
244: 
245: The CLI auto-stashes any local changes inside `.autoforge/`, applies the latest framework snapshot, and restores your data directories (`ai/memory`, `ai/logs`, `change_requests`, etc.). If Git reports conflicts, resolve them, then rerun `npx autoforge validate`.
246: 
247: After upgrading:
248: 
249: - Note the change in your active memory file so the next session knows which rules changed.
250: - Tell your assistant to reload `.autoforge/ai/context.manifest.yaml`, `.autoforge/ai/agents.yaml`, and `docs/ai/COMMIT_PLAYBOOK.md`.
251: 
252: ---
253: 
254: ## 13. CLI reference
255: 
256: - `autoforge init [--force]` — scaffold or refresh `./.autoforge/` (legacy `./autoforge/`) and create `autoforge.config.json`.
257: - `autoforge upgrade` — replace framework-managed files while preserving logs, memory, ideas, and change requests.
258: - `autoforge configure` — regenerate managed files (ai/code_targets.yaml, ai/context_targets.yaml) from `autoforge.config.json`.
259: - `autoforge load` — emit a copy/paste prompt (and log to ai/logs/mastermind/) that instructs your AI tool to reload rules, roles, progress, and memory from the latest context and most recent memory. Alias: `autoforge refresh`.
260: - `autoforge validate` — runs the quality gate checks.
261: - `autoforge doctor` — verifies required files and config are present.
262: - `autoforge version` — prints the installed package version.
263: - `autoforge dryrun [recipeName]` — print a step-by-step execution checklist from a recipe (no writes).
264: 
265: Need framework commands from inside CI or scripts? Prefix with `npx` (e.g., `npx autoforge validate`).
